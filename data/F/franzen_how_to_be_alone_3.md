# On the Uses of Tragedy

A section from "Why Bother" on the importance/relevance of fiction to contemporary life.  

> I hope it's clear that by "tragic" I mean just about any fiction that raises more questions than it answers: anything in which conflict doesn't resolve into cant.  (Indeed, the most reliable indicator of a tragic perspective in a work of fiction is comedy.)  The point of calling serious fiction tragic is to highlight its distance from the rhetoric of optimism that so pervades our culture.  The necessary lie of every successful regime, including the upbeat techno-corporatism under which we now live, is that the regime has made the world a better place.  Tragic realism preserves the recognition that improvement always comes at a cost; that nothing lasts forever; that if the good in the world outweighs the bad, it's by the slimmest of margins.  I suspect that art has always had a particularly tenuous purchase on the American imagination because ours is a country to which so few terrible things have ever happened.  The one genuine tragedy to befall us was slavery, and it's probably no accident that the tradition of Southern literature has been strikingly rich and productive of geniuses.  (Compare the literature of the sunny, fertile, peaceful West Coast.)  Superficially at least, for the great white majority, the history of this country has consisted of success and more success.  Tragic realism preserves access to the dirt behind the dream of Chosenness--to the human difficulty beneath the technological ease, to the sorrow behind the pop-cultural narcosis: to all those portents on the margins of our existence.

The way to despair is to refuse to have any kind of experience, and the novel, of course, is a way to have experience." --Flannery O'Connor [qtd. by Franzen] (91ff)
