# On Suffering

> Life, as we find it, is too hard for us; it brings too many pains, disappointments, and impossible tasks. In order to bear it we cannot dispense with palliative measures. ... There are perhaps three such measures: powerful deflections, which cause us to make light of our misery; substitutive satisfactions, which diminish it; and intoxicating substances, which make us insensitive to it. (23-4)

> What we call happiness in the strictest sense comes from the (preferably sudden) satisfaction of needs which have been dammed up to a high degree, and is from its nature only possible as an episodic phenomenon. ... Unhappiness is much less difficult to experience. (25-6)

# On Religion

> Religion restricts this play of choice and adaptation [of palliative measures], since it imposes equally on everyone its own path to the acquisition of happiness and protection from suffering. Its technique consists in depressing the value of life and distorting the picture of the real world in a delusional manner--which presupposes an intimidation of intelligence. At this price, by forcibly fixing them in a state of psychical infantilism and by drawing them into a mass-delusion, religion succeeds in sparing many people an individual neurosis. But hardly anything more. ... If the believer finally sees himself obliged to speak of God's "inscrutable decrees," he is admitting that all that is left to him as a last possible consolation and source of pleasure in his suffering is an unconditional submission. And if he is prepared for that, he could probably have spared himself the _d√©tour_ he has made. (36)
