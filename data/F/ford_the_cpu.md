# Assembler is the Latin of Programming

> Assembler is the Latin of programming. It helps you understand all the languages that came later; everyone feels guilty for not learning it; but there's a lot of rote learning involved and it's easier to skip (as I have, with both assembler and Latin). But reading about registers, after my decade of programming high-level languages, is like going back to Shakespeare or the Bible and realizing how many times I've heard Hamlet or Julius Caesar, or a proverb about pigs, repeated back to me in books and speechesâ€”it's always been there; I just didn't know to see it.
