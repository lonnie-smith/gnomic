# On Difficulty in Fiction

From "Mr Difficult":

> Fiction is the most fundamental human art.  Fiction is storytelling, and our reality arguably consists of the stories we tell about ourselves.  Fiction is also conservative and conventional, because the structure of its market is relatively democratic (novelists make a living one copy at a time, bringing pleasure to large audiences), and because a novel asks for ten or twenty hours of solitary attentiveness from each member of its audience.  You can walk past a painting fifty times before you begin to appreciate it.  You can drift in and out of a Bartok sonata until its structures dawn on you.  But a difficult novel just sits there on your shelf unread--unless you happen to be a student, in which case you're forced to turn the pages of Woolf and Beckett.

> This may make you a better reader.  But to sign on with the postmodern program, to embrace the notion of formal experimentation as a heroic act of resistance, you have to believe that the emergency that [William] Gaddis and his fellow pioneers were responding to is still an emergency five decades later.  You have to believe that our situation as suburbanized, gasoline-dependent, TV-watching Americans is still so new and urgent as to preempt old-fashioned storytelling.  You have to be some kind of critic.  And once literature and its criticism become codependent, the fallacies set in.

> There's the Fallacy of Capture, as in the frequent praise of _Finnegan's Wake_ for its "capturing" of human consciousness, or in the justification of _JR's_ [one of Gaddis's novels] longueurs by its "capture" of an elusive "postwar American reality"; as if a novel were primarily an ethnographic recording, as if the point of reading fiction were not to go fishing but to admire someone else's catch.  There's the Fallacy of the Symphonic, in which a book's motifs and voices are described as "washing over" the reader in orchestral fashion; as if, when you're reading _JR_, its pages just turn themselves, words wafting up into your head like arpeggios.  And the Fallacy of Art Historicism, a pedagogical convenience borrowed from the moneyed world of visual art, where a work's value substantially depends on its novelty; as if fiction were as formally free as painting, as if what makes _The Great Gatsby_ and _O Pioneers!_ good novels were primarily their technical innovations.  And the epidemic Fallacy of the Stupid Reader, implicit in every modern "aesthetics of difficulty," wherein difficulty is a "strategy" to protect art from co-optation and the purpose of this art is to "upset" or "compel" or "challenge" or "subvert" or "scar" the unsuspecting reader; as if the writer's audience somehow consisted, again and again, of Charlie Brown running to kick Lucy's football; as if it were a virtue in a novelist to be the kind of boor who propagandizes at friendly social gatherings.
