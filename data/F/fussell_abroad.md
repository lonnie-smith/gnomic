This is an odd little book--not really scholarly, and not quite entirely belletristic, though it tries to be--maybe the window was still open for this kind of not-entirely-professionalized academic work in 1980.

# On Travel Books as a Genre

> A travel book, at its purest, is addressed to those who do not plan to follow the traveller at all, but who require the exotic or comic anomalies, wonders, and scandals of the literary form _romance_ which their own place or time cannot entirely supply. Travel books are a sub-species of memoir in which autobiographical narrative arises from the speaker's encounter with distant or unfamiliar data and in which the narrative--unlike that in a novel or a romance--claims literal validity by constant reference to actuality. (203)

> it is thus possible to consider the between-the-wars travel books as a subtle instrument of ethics, replacing such former vehicles as sermons and essays.
>
> A fact of modern publishing history is the virtual disappearance of the essay as a salable commodity (I mean the essay, not the "article"). ... The more we attend to what's going on in the travel book between the wars, the more we perceive that the genre is a device for getting published essays which, without the travel "menstruum" (as Coleridge would say) would appear too old-fashioned for generic credit, too reminiscent of Lamb and Stevenson and Chesterton. (204)

This turns out to be a pretty apt description of what Fussell is doing here: the academic book as a means of getting some essays on travelling published in the guise of a scholarly monograph--thus, the occasion for his peculiar and not very well articulated distinction between a tourist and a traveller (which, like okay... but why not accept that most people are some of both) or his long elegaic passages on the death of travel itself, whose possibility has been foreclosed upon by the emergence of the jet engine, by passports and the bureaucratic regulation of borders, and by the global monoculture of the tourism industry. All impediments, surely, to having truly novel travel experiences, but hardly insurmountable ones. It seems peculiarly parochial to imagine that it's impossible now to step outside the tourism industry or have experiences unmediated by travel posters.
