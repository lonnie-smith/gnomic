# On the American Obsession with Privacy

Franzen's discussion of the American obsession with privacy, particularly recurrent concern about the erosion of privacy.  (He's got an interesting passage earlier, where he says that all the legitimate fears associated with privacy are generally overlap with other concepts--stalking, for example, or identity theft).

This is From "Imperial Bedroom," 46ff.

> Our privacy panic isn't merely exaggerated.  It's founded on a fallacy. Ellen Alderman and Caroline Kennedy, in _The Right to Privacy_, sum up the conventional wisdom of privacy advocates like this: "There is less privacy than there used to be."  This claim has been made or implied so often, in so many books and editorials and talk-show dens, that Americans, no matter how passive they are in their behavior, now dutifully tell pollsters that they're very much worried about privacy.  From almost any historical perspective, however, the claim seems bizarre.

> In 1890, an American typically lived in a small town under conditions of near-panoptical surveillance.  Not only did his every purchase "register," but it registered in the eyes and the memory of shopkeepers who know him, his parents, his wife, and his children.  he couldn't so much as walk to the post office without having his movements tracked and analyzed by neighbors. Probably he grew up sleeping in the same bed with his siblings and possibly with his parents, too.  Unless he was well off, his transportation--a train, a horse, his own two feet--either was communal or exposed him to the public eye.

> In the suburbs and exurbs where the typical American lives today, tiny nuclear families inhabit enormous houses, in which each person has his or her own bedroom and, sometimes, bathroom.  Compared even with suburbs in the sixties and seventies, when I was growing up, the contemporary condominium development or gated community offers a striking degree of anonymity.  It's no longer the rule that you know your neighbors.  Communities increasingly tend to be virtual, the participants either faceless or firmly in control of the face they present.  Transportation is largely private, the latest SUVs are the size of living rooms and come with onboard telephones, CD players, and TV screens; behind the tinted windows of one of those high-riding I-see-you-but-you-can't-see-me mobile PrivacyGuard units, a person can be wearing pajamas or a licorice bikini, for all anybody knows or cares.  Maybe the government intrudes on the family a little more than a hundred years ago (social workers look in on the old and the poor, health officials require innoculations, the police inquire about spousal battery), but these intrusions don't begin to make up for the small-town snooping they've replaced.

> The "right to be left alone?"  Far from disappearing, its exploding.  It's the essence of modern American architecture, landscape, transportation, communication, and mainstream political philosophy.  The real reason that Americans are apathetic about privacy is so big as to be almost invisible: we're flat-out _drowning_ in privacy.

> What's threatened, then, isn't the private sphere.  It's the public sphere. Much has been made of the discouraging effect that the Starr investigation may have on future aspirants to public office (only zealots and zeros need apply), but that's just half of it.  The public world of Washington, because it's public, belongs to everyone.  We're all invited to participate with our votes, our patriotism, our campaigning, and our opinions.  The collective weight of a population makes possible our faith in the public world as something larger and more enduring and more dignified than any messy individual can be in private.  But, just as one sniper in a church tower can keep the streets of an entire town empty, one real grossout scandal can undermine that faith.
