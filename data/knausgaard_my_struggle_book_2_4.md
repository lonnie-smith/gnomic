# On Late Capitalism; Nihilism as a Teenager's Issue

> there were no longer any things or places we had not made our own, and thereby loaded with humanness: our mind had been there. In the context of the divine, humanness was always small and insignificant, and it must have been because of this perspective's enormous import--which perhaps can only be compared with the significance contained in the recognition that knowledge was always a fall--that the notion of the divine arose in the first place, and had now come to an end. For who brooded over the meaninglessness of life anymore? Teenagers. They were the only ones who were preoccupied with existential issues, and as a result there was something puerile and immature about them, and hence it was doubly impossible for adults with their sense of propriety intact to deal with them. However, this is not so strange, for we never feel more strongly and passionately about life than in our teenage years, when we step into the world for the first time, as it were, and all our feelings are new feelings. So there they are, with their big ideas on small orbits, looking this way and that for an opportunity to launch them, as the pressure builds. And who is it they light upon sooner or later but Uncle Dostoevsky? Dostoevsky has become a teenager's write, the issue of nihilism a teenager's issue. How this has come about is hard to say, but the result is at any rate that the whole of this vast question has been disregarded while at the same time all critical energy is directed to the left where it is swallowed up in ideas of justice and equality, which of course are the very ones that legitimize and steer the development of our society and the abyssless life we live within it. The difference between nineteenth-century nihilism and ours is the difference between emptiness and equality. ... We are all democrats ... and the differences between states, cultures, and peoples are being broken down everywhere. And this movement, what else is it at heart if not nihilistic? ... A case in point ... [is] the inclination to find a common denominator for all the complicated tendencies in the world, ... or the determination to convert everything into figures, beauty as well as forests as well as art as well as bodies. For what is money if not an entity that commodifies the most dissimilar things? ... In our century even our dreams are alike, even dreams are things we sell. Undifferentiated, which is just another way of saying indifferent.
