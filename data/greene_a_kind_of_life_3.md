# Conversion

Graham Greene's conversion is another instance where the interesting bits seem almost entirely left out. He starts visiting a priest because he is engaged to marry a Catholic and feels he owes it to her to at least have a basic understanding of the faith's tenants, but expects to remain a "dogmatic" atheist.

> I can only remember that in January 1926 I became convinced of the probable existence of something we call God, though now I dislike the word with all its anthropomorphic associations and prefer Chardin's "Noosphere," and my belief never came by way of those unconvincing philosophical arguments which I derided in a short story called "A Visit to Morin." (168)

He sort of sums up this odd section by noting that

> with the approach of death I care less and less about religious truth. One hasn't long to wait for revelation or darkness (168)

This isn't a spiritual autobiography, but even so, the lack of care on this is pretty striking. His indifference to popular theology, or even "religious truth" doesn't seem to square very well with his description, a bit later, of consulting with a priest about whether he should have children. The priest tells him that he mustn't use contraception, but should instead "trust God."

> How differently he would have answered my question today, telling me, I have no doubt, to follow my conscience, which even then was elastic enough for almost anything. (193)

What use does a person like this have for Catholic dogma? I can see its attraction for him as a subject, but I wish I could see more of what he sought in encumbering himself with it as a personal identity.
