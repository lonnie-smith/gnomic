# On Cruelty and Animals

> And though abjuring cruelty was White's Word, animals played a curious role in keeping it. Riding out with the Old Surrey and Barstow Hunt, White recorded the first time he saw a kill with distanced fascination. The fox was dug out of a drain where it had taken refuge and thrown to the hounds. They tore it to pieces while a circle of human onlookers "screeched them on." The humans, White thought, were disgusting, their cries "tense, self-conscious, and hysterically animal." But the hounds were not. "The savagery of the hounds," he wrote, "was deep-rooted and terrible, but rang true, so that it was not horrible like that of the human."

> In this bloody scene, only one man escaped White's revulsion: the huntsman, a red-faced, grave, and gentlemanly figure who stood by the hounds and blew the _mort_ on his hunting horn, the formal act of parting to commemorate the death of the fox. By some strange alchemy--his closeness to the pack, his expert command of them--the huntsman was not horrible. For White, it was a moral magic trick, a way out of his conundrum. By skillfully training a hunting animal, by closely associating with it, you might be allowed to experience all your vital, sincere desires, even your most bloodthirsty ones, in total innocence. You could be true to yourself. (42-3)

# On Authenticity

...in the account of a researcher experimenting on chaffinches

> to try to understand how they learned to sing," raising the birds in isolation to see if they still learn to produce the characteristic songs, "a science soaked deep in Cold War anxieties. The question Thorpe was asking were those of a post-war West, obsessed with identity and frightened of brainwashing. How do you learn who you are? Can allegiances be changed? Can you be trusted? What makes you a chaffinch? Where do you come from?

By wrapping this in the discredited politics of the Cold War, Macdonald distances herself from these questions. Why? Where _does_ "you" come from?

Training a hawk is about "becoming invisible"--watching the hawk, her father's photography, bird-watching--all pay a kind of devotion to that thing watched, but also imply something pathological, psychosexually suspect as in the world of LeCarre's cold-war spies, or mid-century schoolboys, or, maybe more sadly, simply separate from life, a refusal of participation as in the case of Macdonald's father, viewing horrors or daily life through an always-present viewfinder. Becoming invisible exists in an uncomfortable tension with the the kind of insight, a seeing into the truth of things, that a birdwatcher, or hawk trainer, is supposed to have.

> To train a hawk you must watch it like a hawk, and so you come to understand its moods. Then you gain the ability to predict what it will do next. ... Eventually, you don't see the hawk's body language at all. You seem to feel what it feels, notice what it notices. The hawk's apprehension becomes your own. You are exercising what the poet Keats called your chameleon quality, the ability to "tolerate a loss of self and a loss of rationality by trusting in the capacity to recreate onesself in another character or another environment." Such a feat of imaginative recreation has always come easily to me. Too easily. It's part of being a watcher, forgetting who you are and putting yourself in the thing you are watching. That is why the girl who was in me when I was small loved watching birds. She made herself disappear, and then in the birds she watched, took flight [you can see why she loved Merlyn's turning Wart into a hawk] It was happening now. I had put myself in the hawk's wild mind to tame her, and as the days passed in the darkened room my humanity was burning away. (86)
