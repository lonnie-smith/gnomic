# On the Knowledge of Good and Evil

> Good and evil we know in the field of this world grow up together almost inseperably, and the knowledge of good is so involved and interwoven with the knowledge of evil, and in so many cunning resemblances hardly to be discerned, that those confused seeds which were imposed on Psyche as an incessant labor to cull out and sort assunder, were not more intermixed. It was from out the rind of one apple tasted, that the knowledge of good and evil, as two twins cleaving together, leaped forth into the world. And perhaps this is that doom which Adam fell into of knowing good and evil, that is say, of knowing good by evil.
>
> As therefore the state of man now is, what wisdom can there be to choose, what continence to forbear, without the knowledge of evil? (728)

# On Free Will

> Many there be that complain of divine providence for suffering Adam to transgress. Foolish tongues! When God gave him reason, he gave him freedom to choose, for reason is but choosing; he had been else a mere artificial Adam, such an Adam as he is in the motions. We ourselves esteem not of that obedience, or love, or gift, which is of force. Got therefore left him free, set before him a provoking object, ever almost in his eyes; herein consisted his merit, herein the right of his reward, the praise of his abstinence. Wherefore did he create passions within us, pleasures round about us, but that these rightly tempered are the very ingredients of virute? They are not skillful considerers of huyman things who imagine to remove sin by removing the matter of sin. ... Banish all objects of lust, shut up all youth into the severest discipline that can be exercised in any hermitage, ye cannot make them chaste that came not thither so: such great care and wisdom is required to the right management of this point. (733)


# On Truth and Orthodoxy

> Truth is compared in scripture to a streaming fountain; if her waters flow not in a perpetual progression, they sicken into a muddy pool of conformity and tradition. A man may be a heretic in the truth; and if he beleive things only because his pastor says so, or the Assembly so determines, without knowing other reason, though is belief be true, yet the very truth he holds becomes his heresy.
