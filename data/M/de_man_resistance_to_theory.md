# On Truth and Reference in Literary Language

De Man locates "literariness" in the places where language's slipperiness is most salient:

> The relationship between word and thing is not phenomenal but conventional. This gives language considerable freedom from referential restraint, but makes it epistemplogically suspect and volatile, since its use can no longer be said to be determined by considerations of truth and falsehood, good and evil, beauty and ugliness, pleasure and pain. Whenever this autonomous potential of language can be revealed by analysis, we are dealing with literariness and, in fact, with literature as the place where this negative knowledge about the reliability of linguistic utterance is made available. (10)

> By allowing for the necessity of a non-phenomenal linguistics, one frees the discourse on literature from naive oppositions between fiction and reality, which are themselves an offspring of an uncritically mimetic conception of art. In a genuine semiology, as well as in other linguistically oriented theories, the referential function of language is not being denied--far from it; what is in question is its authority as a model for natural or phenomenal cognition. Literature is fiction not because it somehow refuses to acknowledge "reality," but because it is not _a priori_ certain that language functions according to principles which are those, or which are _like_ those, of the phenomenal world. It is therefore not _a priori_ certain that literature is a reliable source of information about anything but its own language. (11)

# On Ideology as the Confusion of Linguistic and Natural Reality

De Man's weird definition of ideology:

> What we call ideology is precisely the confusion of linguistic with natural reality, of reference with phenomenalism. It follows that, more than any other mode of inquiry including economics, the linguistics of literariness is a powerful and indispensible tool in the unmasking of ideological aberration, as well as a determining factor in accounting for their occurrence.
