# On a Ph.D. as Career Preparation

From _Cross Currents_ 49.3 (1999): 303-18.

>As a Harvard humanities Ph.D. most of whose postgraduation career has transpired outside academe, I have been invited several times to speak to graduate students about the other careers for which their doctorates may prepare them. In retrospect, although I myself gained from being forced to review how leaving academe had changed me, I rather regret accepting those invitations.

> I regret accepting them in the first place because, although I may have left behind a useful tip or two, I did the graduate students a disservice by lending credence to the view that American-style doctoral education makes sense as a preparation for a wide variety of careers. I doubt that it does. While it is difficult ever to say what portion of a man or woman's knowledge will not someday be useful, the full-blown humanities doctorate--particularly if it is followed by long years of probationary appointments and then a negative tenure decision--grievously delays a young person's entry into the general marketplace, burdens him or her with enormous debt, and inculcates over the years the self-destructive habit of constant subtle deference. Humane learning has many uses in the general marketplace, but the baroque peculiarity of American doctoral education produces an animal hyper-adapted to the baroque peculiarity of the American academic habitat.
