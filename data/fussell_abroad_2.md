# On the Imperialism of Fiction

> Certainly the travel book will have little generic prestige in today's atmosphere, where if you identify yourself as a "writer," everyone will assume you're a novelist. The genres with current prestige are the novel and the lyric poem, although it doesn't seem to matter that very few memorable examples of either ever appear. The status of those two kinds is largely an unearned and unexamined snob increment from late romantic theories of the imaginative art as religion-cum-metaphysics. Other kinds of works--those relegated to simple-minded categories like "the literature of fact" or "the literature of argument"--are in lower esteem artistically because the term _creative_ has been widely misunderstood, enabling its votaries to vest it with magical powers. Before that word had been promoted to the highest esteem, that is, before the romantic movement, a masterpiece was conceivable in a "non-fictional" genre like historiography or memoir or the long essay or biography or the travel book. (213)

Fussell's most enjoyable and workst tendencies are to snarky polemicism, sometimes perceptive, sometimes nuanced, sometimes entertaining even at the expense of being wrong.

There's something true here about the prestige of the novel, but it's also starting to look pretty dated, and I wonder if the attitudes dis-esteem for non-fiction, attributed diffusively to "today's atmosphere" would actually have been held by any thoughtful reader at the time. Today, I'm not sure if anyone would call, say, Malcolm Gladwell's books "masterpieces," but no writer of novels is commanding that kind of attention. Everyone complains about the glut of memoirs, though maybe that attests to the authority we grant to personal authenticity, or maybe the erosion of other types of authority having created a vacuum that fiction can't quite fill. (There's even a sense in which fiction takes on a memoir-like quality in which the writer's authority only extends so far as can be commensurate with his own personal experience.)
