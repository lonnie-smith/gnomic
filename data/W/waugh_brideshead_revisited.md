# On English Architecture

I think that Waugh was probably a pretty disagreeable person (at least, his narrator is), but enjoyed the book anyway.  In a way, the two-page preface is the most interesting part of the book; Waugh claims the book (finished during an extended convalescence from a parachute injury sustained in 1943)

> lost me much esteem as I once enjoyed among my contemporaries and led me into an unfamiliar world of fan-mail and press photographers. ...
>
> It was impossible to foresee, in the spring of 1944, the present cult of the English country house.  It seemed then that the ancestral seats which were our chief national artistic achievement were doomed to decay and spoilation like the monasteries in the sixteenth century.  Brideshead today would be open to trippers, it treasures rearranged by expert hands and the fabric better maintained than it was by Lord Marchmain.  And the English aristocracy has maintained its identity to a degree that then seemed impossible.  The advance of Hooper has been held up at several points.  Much of this book therefore is a panegyric preached over an empty coffin.  ... It is offered to a younger generation of readers as a souvenir of the Second War rather than of the twenties or of the thirties, with which it ostensibly deals.

Here's something from the narrator on his diffidently chosen career as an architectural painter.

> My work upheld me, for I had chosen to do what I could do well, did better daily, and liked doing; incidentally it was something no one else at that time was attempting to do.  I became an architectural painter.
>
> More even than the work of the great architects, I loved buildings that grew silently with the centuries, catching and keeping the best of each generation, while time curbed the artist's pride and the Philistine's vulgarity, and repaired the clumsiness of the dull workman.  In such buildings England abounded, and, in the last decade of their grandeur, Englishmen seemed for the first time to become conscious of what before was taken for granted, and to salute their achievement at the moment of extinction.
