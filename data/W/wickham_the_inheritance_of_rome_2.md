# The Economic Basis of Medieval States

A crucial change in economic relations moving into the early medieval period was a change from taxes to landowning as the principal source of wealth:

> Tax was, that is to say, no longer the basis of the state. For kings as well as armies, landowning was the major source of wealth from now on. This was a crucial change. Tax-raising states are much richer than most land-based ones, for property taxes are generally collected from very many more people than pay rent to a ruler from his public land. (101)

Despite local differences in political style, Spain, France, and Italy all charted a similar course away from the Roman empire and into the early Middle Ages, and should be understood as "products of development from Roman antecedents":

> They all moved towards social and political hierarchies dominated by military identity; civilian aristocracies vanished. (This happened in the Byzantine empire as well, first in Italy, but eventually even in the Byzantine heartland.) Steadily, at different speeds, they lost control of tax-raising, and became essentially land-based political systems, although all three managed to keep aristocratic political practice and even identity firmly concentrated on royal courts. Indeed, even though all three experienced periods of royal weakness and political fragmentation, successful rulers could in each case re-focus the aristocracy on them, Leovigild after 569, Agilulf after 590, Charles Martel after 719. All three also saw their political identity in ethnic terms, as Franks, Goths and Lombards, but ethnicity rapidly became unimportant in practice: by 700 most ‘Franks’ had ancestors who had been Roman, and the same is true for Spain and Italy. Indeed, apart from the continuing importance of assemblies ... and the assumption that military service was due from all free males, at least in theory (never in practice), there was not so much that was specifically Germanic in the ‘Romano-Germanic’ kingdoms. Politics, society and culture had moved on from the Roman world, but they can most usefully be understood as products of development from Roman antecedents. (146)

# The Economic Basis of Political Violence

> But throughout Francia the simple fact that major aristocrats could be hugely rich meant that politics would be more violent, for all secular aristocratic identity was military by now--even career administrators at court were regarded as having obligations to fight, and dressed in military fashion, with an elaborate belt of office--and what landed wealth could buy above all was an armed entourage, to make one’s ambition more clearly marked. It was the existence of such entourages that underpins the faction-fighting of, in particular, the later seventh century, but going back to Rauching and Ursio and earlier power was not local, and did not have to be defended by walls; it was seen as royal. That is to say, it came from office or from Königsnähe, and preferably both. All great landowners aimed at these, or at their ecclesiastical equivalents; their wealth and armed men were focused on these, not on local autonomy and domination. (122)
