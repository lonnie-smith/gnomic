# On the Early Arab Period

Wickham thinks the Islamic empires of the medieval era preserved Roman imperial culture perhaps better than other post-Roman polities:

> the early Arab period is crucial for us to confront. The caliphate did not rule any part of Europe before the Arab-Berber invasion of Spain in 711, but it cannot be excluded from a history of the Continent. For a start, it was the Arabs who broke in half the surviving section of the Roman empire in the seventh century, ending for ever its dream of continued Mediterranean hegemony, and forcing it to reinvent itself as the state we call Byzantium ... Secondly, the caliphate was itself built on Roman foundations (as also Sassanian Persian foundations). Notwithstanding the difficulty and unfamiliarity of our narrative sources for it, it arguably preserved the parameters of imperial Roman society more completely than any other part of the post-Roman world, at least in the period up to 750; this is a paradox which it is essential to explore. Thirdly, the caliphate was simply richer and more powerful than any other post-Roman polity. By now it was the Arabs that dominated the Mediterranean. (279-80)

# On Architecture and Political Style in the Islamic World

Wickham explains the characteristic narrow streets of medieval islamic cities because mosques and palaces, rather than streets, were the site of political theater:

> In the Islamic world, the mosque courtyard took over from all of these; major political events, like collective oaths of loyalty, took place there, not in any secular location. And the Arab states did not use processions as a major part of their political legitimization; the assembly in the mosque courtyard was sufficient for that. The need for wide boulevards ended; pre-Islamic Syrian and Palestinian colonnades were quite quickly filled in with shops in the eighth century, some of them commissioned as public amenities by caliphs. The narrow streets of Islamic cities resulted directly from this, for there was no public interest involved in keeping them clear from obstructions like vendors’ stalls, beyond a certain minimum (enough for two loaded pack animals to pass each other, later jurists said). Public display came to be focused on the mosque, and, secondarily, rulers’ palaces and city gates, rather than on the cityscape as a whole. (235)

# On Medieval Baghdad as a Cultural Center

> Baghdad, although by no means part of a history of Europe, or even of the former Roman world, had an economic and cultural importance in the last third of our period that outclassed anywhere in the world, and that certainly impacted on Europe: on Spain, on Constantinople, and even on far-off Aachen, where Charlemagne’s court paid attention to that of Harun al-Rashid, even if the reverse was probably not the case. (333)

> Ninth-century Baghdad, huge, wealthy and politically central as it was, became a real cultural focus. The startlingly large number of surviving works in Arabic from the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly (particularly before the 930s or so) written in or near the capital, themselves attest to it. They are only a portion of what was actually written, too, as is shown by the Fihrist or Index of al-Nadim (d. c. 990), which lists over 6,000 book titles, nearly all written in the last 250 years ...

# Islamic Literary Culture

> These branches of knowledge increasingly developed their own microcultures, with lawyers above all reading other lawyers, historians reading other historians, poets reading other poets. They were tied together, all the same, by two main networks, one cultural-religious, one literary. The intellectual strata as a whole were seen as a community of scholars, the ‘ulam’ (from ‘ilm, ‘religious knowledge’). The community was defined initially and principally in terms of religious expertise, but came soon to extend out to the more specialized disciplines; its identity is most visible in biographical dictionaries of scholars, which were already being written in the early ninth century. It was this community, led by Qur’anic scholars and jurists, which was increasingly seen, in a religion with no formal priesthood or ecclesiastical hierarchy, as the determinators of what Islam was and how it should be understood, and indeed, in the twenty-first century, it still is. (339)

# On Polite Education as Qualification for Office

Wickham sees continuity between Rome's literary culture and that of the early Medieval Islamic world

> The other way in which the realms of written culture were linked was through adab, roughly translatable as ‘polite education’, or ‘literary etiquette’. This became the foundation of Arab written culture by around 800, and remained so throughout our period and beyond. It linked our period and beyond. It linked learning with stylistic elegance, and required of its practitioners a general knowledge of most of the intellectual disciplines of the period, but particularly language, poetry, stories, administrative practice and adth. The administrative practice is the give-away: adab was above all a qualification for careers in government. It was the exact equivalent of the senatorial literary education of the Roman empire and of the classical and theological training necessary for administrators in Byzantium after 900, except that the knowledge it required was mostly of a much more recent vintage. And indeed the scope of intellectual activity in Baghdad and other centres showed the range of skills that were acceptable in government; intellectuals from the geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. c. 885) to the seriously influential and original philosopher-physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna, d. 1037) held governmental and administrative offices. This range marks one of the particularities of adab. So also, however, does storytelling. Literary culture gave considerable space to narratives; ‘Abbasid histories are composed of thousands of short exemplary accounts, with plenty of direct quotations, supposedly taken from the lips of caliphs and their advisers. Rhetorical skill required remarkably recondite knowledge as part of such storytelling; hence the existence of several encyclopedias of ‘curiosities’ ... This knowledge, these days restricted to adolescent boys, was in this period a requirement for statecraft, along with knowing how to write a letter properly and memorizing the Qur’an. (340)
