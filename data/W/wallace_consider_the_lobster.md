# On Updike's Solipsism

From "Certainly the End of _Something_ or Other, One Would Sort Of Have To Think", a review of Updike's _Toward The End Of Time_.

> I'm guessing that for the young educated adults of the sixties and seventies, for whom the ultimate horror was the hypocritical conformity and repression of their own parents' generation, Updike's evection of the libidinous self appeared refreshing and even heroic.  But young adults of the nineties--many of whom are, of course, the children of the impassioned infidelities and divorces Updike wrote about so beautifully, and who got to watch all the brave new individualism and sexual freedom deteriorate into the joyless and anomic self-indulgence of the Me Generation--today's subforties have very different horrors, prominent among which are anomie and solipsism and a peculiarly American loneliness: the prospect of dying without even once having loved something more than yourself.
