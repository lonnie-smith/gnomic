# The Ethics of Aestheticism

This is a view of the life rightly lived. Pater distills a certain philosophy of mind, finding the total of human experience is a kind of heightened solipsism:

> each mind keeping as a solitary prisoner its own dream of the world

... going a step further into a fully buddhist claim about the nature of subjectivity or identity,

> a tremulous wisp constantly reforming itself on the stream ... that strange, perpetual weaving and unweaving of ourselves.

If this is life--if this is what it means to have a consciousness, he draws this out into an ethics, or at least a definition of what a good life is:

> The service of philosophy, of speculative culture, towards the human spirit, is to rouse, to startle it to a life of constant and eager observation. ... Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end. A counted number of pulses only is given to us ... How may we see in them all that is to be seen in them by the finest senses? How shall we pass most swiftly from point to point, and be present always at the focus where the greatest number of vital forces unite in their purest energy?

> To burn always with this hard and gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life. In a sense it might even be said that our failure is to form habits: for after all, habit is relative to a stereotyped world, and meantime it is only the roughness of the eye that makes any two persons, things, situations, seem alike. ... Not to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those about us, and in the very brilliancy of their gifts some tragic dividing of forces on their ways is, on this short day of frost and sun, to sleep before evening. With this sense of the splendor of our experience and of its awful brevity, gathering all that we are into one desperate effort to see and touch, we shall hardly have time to form theories about the things we see and touch. What we have to do is be forever curiously testing new opinions and courting new impressions, never acquiescing in a facile orthodoxy. ... Philosophical theories or ideas ... may help us to gather up what might otherwise pass unregarded by us. ...

> ... we have an interval, and then our place knows us no more. Some spend this interval in listlessness, some in high passions, the wisest, at least among "the children of this world," in art and song. For our one chance lies in expanding that interval; in getting as many pulsations as possible into the given time. Great passions may give us this quickened sense of life, ecstasy and sorrow of love, the various forms of enthusiastic activity, disinterested or otherwise, which come naturally to many of us. Only be sure it is passion--that it does yield you this fruit of a quickened, multiplied consciousness. Of such wisdom, the poetic passion, the desire of beauty, the love of art for its own sake, has most. For art comes to you proposing frankly to give nothing but the highest quality to your moments as they pass, and simply for those moments' sake. 

This is not about taste, insofar as the objects that inspire "this quickened sense of life" are really a matter of indifference. It's a mode of engaging with art, and with the world: a particular sensitivity one cultivates, which might well fall in the category of a 

> theory or idea or system which requires of us the sacrifice of any part of this experience, in consideration of some interest into which we cannot enter, or some abstract theory we have not identified with ourselves, or of what is only conventional.

# On Solipsism

> Experience ... is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be without.

If you start by assuming that real human contact is a kind of fantasy, a "group of impressions" in the mind of the observer, it's not particularly surprising that you get an ethics that doesn't seem to be particularly interested in other people except as a source of impressions, on an equal footing with

> strange dyes, strange colors, and curious odours, or work of the artist's hands, or the face of one's friend.

Concern for one's fellow creatures occupies a secondary position: it's a thing you can do if it gives you "pulsations" of that "quickened sense of life".  If this attitude doesn't actively encourage indifference to suffering, it certainly doesn't condemn it either.

On the other hand, there is something rousing here about the treatment of intellectual complacency as a real evil: "our failure is to form habits"--facile orthodoxies--an insistence that being actually alive requires constant mental motion, that without "for ever curiously testing new opinions and courting new impressions" is a moral failing of a kind, or at least a failure to lead a good life.

There's something worth rescuing here, the danger of habit to ossify and deaden one's mind, supplanting particularity with familiar generalities. It's tempting to read this as an epistemological complaint that habit blinds us to the _actual_, but Pater doesn't believe we have access to the actual. The real problem with habit is that it inhibits the dance of impressions, that conventional ways of thinking make us less able to be present for vital experiences.
