# On the Ethics of Architecture

> Any object of design will give off an impression of the psychological and moral attitudes it supports. ...
>
> In essence, what works of design and architecture talk to us about is the kind of life that would most appropriately unfold within and around them. They tell us of certain moods that they seek to encourage and sustain in their inhabitants.  While keeping us warm and helping us in mechanical ways, they simultaneously hold out an invitation for us to be specific sorts of people.  They speak of visions of happiness.

> To describe a building as beautiful therefore suggests more than a mere aesthetic fondness; it implies an attraction to the particular way of life this structure is promoting through its roof, door handles, window frames, staircase and furnishings.  A feeling of beauty is a sign that we have come upon a material articulation of certain of our ideas of a good life.
>
> Similarly, buildings will strike us as offensive not because they violate a private and mysterious visual preference but because they conflict with our understanding of the rightful sense of existence--which helps to explain the seriousness and viciousness with which disputes about fitting architecture tend to unfold.
