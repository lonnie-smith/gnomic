# On Modernist Architecture's Roots in Engineering

From the section on the history of
architectural style--de Botton seems to be most interested in the modernist
period (and its fallout).  According to de Botton, modernism arose in answer to
the kind of stylistic anarchy of the late Victorian period, when styles were
proliferating thanks to the diversification of upper-class life due to the
upward mobility of the middle classes.  The problem was that there seemed to be
no dominant architectural principle:

> But where could such a principle be found?  Just what style were architects to build in?
>
> The answer that eventually emerged was not really an answer; rather, it was an admonishment that it might be irrelevant and even indulgent to raise the question in the first place.
>
> A prohibition against discussions of beauty in architecture was imposed by a new breed of men, engineers, who had achieved professional recognition only in the late eighteenth century, but had thereafter risen quickly to dominance in the construction of the new buildings of the Industrial Revolution. Mastering the technologies of iron and steel, of plate glass and concrete, they drew interest and inspired awe with their bridges, railway hangars, aqueducts and docks.  More novel even than their abilities, perhaps, was the fact that they seemed to complete these projects without ever directly asking themselves what style it was best to adopt.  Charged with erecting a bridge, they tried to design the lightest possible frame that could stretch over the widest span at the lowest cost.  When they built a railway station, they aimed for a hall that would allow steam to disperse safely, let in a large amount of natural light and accommodate a constant crowd of travellers.  They demanded that factories be able to house unwieldly machinery and that steamships carry cargoes of impatient passengers punctually across heavy seas.  But they did not appear to give much thought to whether there should be a Corinthian or a Doric set of capitals gracing the upper galleries of a ship, whether a Chinese dragon might look pleasing at the end of a locomotive or whether suburban gas works should be done up in a Tuscan or Islamic style.
