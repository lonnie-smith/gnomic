# On the Crime of Bad Architecture

> The building of new houses typically is synonymous with desecration, with the birth of neighborhoods less beautiful than the countryside they have replaced.
>
> However bitter this equation, we conventionally accept it with passivity and resignation.  Our acquiescence stems from the authority that buildings can acquire through the simple fact of their existence.  Their mass and solidity, the lack of clues as to their origins, the difficulty and cost involved in removing them, lends them the unchallengeable conviction of an ugly cliff-face or hill.
>
> We therefore refrain from raising of the tower block, the new antique village or the riverside mansion that most basic and incensed of political questions: 'Who did this?'  Yet an investigation of the process by which buildings rise reveals that unfortunate cases can in the end always be attributed no the hand of god, or to any immovable economic or political necessities, or to the entrenched wishes of purchasers, or to some new depths of human depravity, but to a pedestrian combination of low ambition, ignorance, greed and accident.
>
> A development which spoils ten square miles of countryside will be the work of a few people neither particularly sinful nor malevolent.  They may be called Derek or Malcolm, Hubert or Shigeru, they may love golf and animals, and yet, in a few weeks, they can put in motion plans which will substantially ruin a landscape for 300 years or more.
>
> The same kind of banal thinking which in literature produces nothing worse than incoherent books and tedious plays can, when applied to architecture, leave wounds which will be visible from outer space.  Bad architecture is a frozen mistake writ large.  But it is only a mistake, and, despite the impressive amounts of scaffolding, concrete, noise, money and bluster which tend to accompany its appearance, it is no more deserving of our deference than a blunder in any other area of life.  We should be as unintimidated by architectural mediocrity as we are by unjust laws or nonsensical arguments.
