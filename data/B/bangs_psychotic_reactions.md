# On the Bangs Style: music as social medium

Analysis and structure seem to be things that Bangs could do without. I'm not
sure how he did this; in part it's because he has lighting-flash
insights often enough that he doesn't have to bother with any sort of
sustained analysis or straightforward reasoning, which is a big plus because
it really helps him capture contradictory ideas without looking like a
fool; in part it's because he just sort of starts in one place and rambles
on to the next place--you have to sort of surrender yourself to the flow of
the piece like you would to the flow of narrative in a fiction.  You can see
this flow in his sentences, which sort of keep extending themselves until
he's ready for a new paragraph (pulling out short excerpts turns out to be
surprisingly tricky).

# On Fame and Authenticity

Bangs has a deep and sometimes vitriolic suspicion of
superstars, which, at least sometimes, seems to be rooted in or disguising a
dubious and largely unacknowledged search for authenticity; his insistence
on a certain kind of expressiveness, or on genuine feeling, or the ability
to evoke or provoke it

# On Formalism in Music Criticism

Bangs is very good at catching what's distinctive and interesting
about a piece of music (e.g. Van Morrison's "verbal tics" on _Astral Weeks_);
one thing that I like about this is that this is rarely presented for its
own sake (c.f Sasha Frere-Jones, who is often concerned exclusively, albeit
interestingly, with technique); Bangs is always putting technique the analysis of formal elements of music,
to some other purpose.  

# On Music Criticism

Maybe what's most remarkable about Bangs is how few words he
expends on explaining what music sounds like; part of what I like about his
writing is how the music (per se) is always subordinated to some larger
point--the existential problems it deals with, or how it speaks to its
cultural moment, or autobiographical musings about the place the song or
album fills in the soundtrack of the writer's private life.  This is crucial--part of what we like about music, maybe even more than about other arts,
is the way that it works as a social medium; that's why where an album fits into a friend's top-10 list matters
more to us than its influences, and why nostalgia is such a powerful influence
on our taste (I don't think we feel nostalgic about books or paintings or
even films or TV shows in quite the same way that we feel nostalgic about
pop music--the music you loved in middle school never becomes a joke in
quite the same way as the TV shows you used to watch). This is why pop music is
assumed to be a crucial element of social identity in a way that other pop
arts aren't; why homogenized radio programming was so much more
of a tragedy than homegenized television (radio was always a more personal
medium than the TV: reduced consumer choice matters less than the loss of local social
context. This is why the average record review is so much less
interesting than the average movie review: we don't care what the music
_sounds_ like, particularly; we care about what it does for us. The typical record review, composed of a splattering of
useless adjectives ("hooky", "rootsy"), a bit of discography ("debut," "sophomore effort," etc.), and the obligatory
recitation of influences, fails to speak to what music does for us.  In fact, music reviews, seeing as how they have to be published
within days of an album's release, can hardly be worthwhile
reading.
We'd rather hear how or why an album finds an audience.  Who are its fans?
What do they get out of it?  All too often--and even Bangs falls prey to the
impulse--critics don't even bother to understand the appeal of music they
don't like; they blame the popularity of bad music on the commercial
enterprise that produced and promoted it.  I guess one should be careful not
to fall into armchair sociology (speculation about why some other bunch of people
like music you don't will almost certainly embarrass you later). Still, an admission that you don't
understand the appeal of a music seems more defensible than blaming the
stupidity or cupidity of someone else for the popularity of a piece of
music.

# On Authenticity and Hipness

Bangs' relationship to authenticity is complicated. He was clearly suspicious of self-awareness--hence his
insistence on the idea that Lou Reed and Iggy Pop didn't know what they were
doing.  But maybe I wouldn't want to go as far as he does in making this
particular brand of innocence into a virtue; just because some artists can
achieve a certain kind of greatness by being simple-minded doesn't mean that
being simple-minded is a virtue in and of itself.  If anything, it's a
negative virtue, not a positive one.
