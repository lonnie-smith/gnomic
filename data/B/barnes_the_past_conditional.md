# On the Usefulness of Opposing Views

From an aimless, pleasantly anglophilic personal history piece in the _New Yorker_:

> My mother, as you can tell, was a clear-minded and opinionated woman who did not have much time for opposing views.  Her dominance of the family, and her certainties about the world, made things usefully clear in childhood, restrictive in adolesence, and grindingly repetitive in adulthood.
