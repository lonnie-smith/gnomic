# On Gratifying Whim

> The pleasure of gratifying whim is very great. It is known only by those who are whimsical. (80)

# On Catching the "Sad Distemper"

> The evening was passed most cheerfully. When I got home, though, then came sorrow. Too, too plain was Signor Gonorrhoea. (155)

# On Imagining His Character In Posterity

Here is a passage representative of the best thing about Boswell--his uninhibited, unembarrassed self-celebration. After writing what he clearly imagines to be a very clever letter to his erstwhile patron, there is this guileless bit of dreaming:

> Surely I am a man of genius. I deserve to be taken notice of. O that my grandchildren might read this character of me: "James Boswell, a most amiable man. He improved and beautified his paternal estate of Auchinleck; made a distinguished figure in Parliament; had the honour to command a regiment of footguards, and was one of the brightest wits in the court of George the Third." (181)

The pathos of this is that none of it came to be, except maybe the "amiable man" bit. Boswell is remembered far more than he might have imagined, but making fun of Boswell the imbecile biographer of the mighty Johnson was virtually a national sport during the Nineteenth Century, and today he's remembered less for his wit than for his amiability.

# On Friendship and Drinking Buddies

> My connections with Erksine and Dempster are really not those of friendship. We are in the style of companions. It is only fancy that cements us. It is only because we are entertaining to one another that we are so much together ... Thank heaven! I have some true friends ... to these I can unbosom my anxious mind; from these I am sure of sympathy and kindness. Besides, these all agree with me in many things which are of consequence. They all, with me, look forward to another world, which Dempster and Erskine never think of. (191)
