> Duties and studies and exertions are painful; for these, too, are necessarily compulsions unless they become habitual; then habit makes them pleasurable. (I.11.4)

> But since rhetoric is concerned with making a judgment ..., it is necessary not only to look to the argument, that it may be demonstrative and persuasive but also [for the speaker] to construct a view of himself as a certain kind of person and to prepare the judge; for it makes much difference in persuasion ... that the speaker seem to be a certain kind of person and that his hearers suppose him to be disposed toward them in a certain way. (II.1.2)

# On Pithiness and Logical Error

Aristotle, in the section on various sorts of fallacy, mentions the fallacy that "seems to result from the shape of an expression" when a statement expressed "compactly and antithetically" appears to be an enthymeme. Kennedy gloses this "The hearer accepts the verbal form as the equivalent of logical validity" (II.24.2)

# On "Urbanity" in Rhetoric

> those things are necessarily urbane, both in _lexis_ and in enthymemes, which create quick learning in our minds. That is why superficial enthymemes are not popular [with audiences] (by _superficial_ I mean those that are altogether clear and which there is no need to ponder), nor [are] those which, when stated, are unintelligible, but those [are popular] of which there is either immediate understanding when they are spoken, even if that was not previously existing, or the thought follows soon after; for [then] some kind of learning takes place ... in terms of lexis, [an expression is urbane] on the one had because of shaped language, and if it is spoken with some contrast ... or on the other hand because of the words, if they have metaphor ... [To achieve urbanity in style] one should thus aim at three things: metaphor, antithesis, and actualization (III.10.4-5)

* _Lexis_, according to Kennedy's glossary, is "how something is said, style, often word choice, sometimes composition of sentences or speeches" 
* _Shaped language_: "'Schemata,' which becomes the word for 'figures of speech.'"
