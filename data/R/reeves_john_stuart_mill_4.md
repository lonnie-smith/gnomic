# On Being a Partisan and a Philosopher

Reeves thinks that Mill's philosophy was very much informed by prior political commitments and work as a partisan journalist.

> Periods of intense partisan interest and involvement in political matters by Mill ... were typically followed by an abrupt disengagement, accompanied by bitter denunciations of politics, politicians, and sometimes the general population, and a recommitment to a life of the mind.
>
> Serious-minded students of Mill's life sometimes appear to lament the waste of energy of his partisan periods ... Mill's political periods, however, vitally informed his scholarly efforts: works whose purpose was always to clear the ground for social, economic, and political reform. (147)
