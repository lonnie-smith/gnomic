# On the Relationship Between Programming and Literature

> Is programming a kind of creative writing?  The notion seems outlandish at first blush.  Any discipline that involves complex mathematics and symbolic logic does not seem to share the same cubbyhole with poetry and self-expression.  Yet the programming field could learn much from the writing world, argues Richard Gabriel, a veteran of the Lisp and object-oriented programming worlds who is now a Distinguished Engineer at Sun.  "My view is that we should train developers the way we train creative people like poets and artists.  People may say, 'Well, that sounds really nuts.'  But what do people do when they're being trained, for example, to get a master of fine arts in poetry?  They study great works of poetry.  Do we do that in our software engineering disciplines?  No.  You don't look at the source code for great pieces of software.  You don't look at the design.  You don't study the lives of great software designers.  So you don't study the literature of the thing you're trying to build." ...

> Gabriel's enthusiasm for the notion of programming as creative writing is not purely abstract; in the 1990s, he took three years off from his career to get an MFA in creative writing and to write a poem a day.  He discovered that we ask more work of students who want to become writers and poets than of those who aim to become software developers: They must study with mentors, they must present their work for regular criticism by peers in workshops, and they're expected to labor over multiple revisions of the same work.  "I think we need to be ashamed of this," Gabriel says.  "What we put forward as computer education is a farce."  (299-300)

> Although [Donald Knuth] is best known for his relatively abstruse work in algorithms, he is also the advocate of a concept that he calls "literate programming."  Literate programming is intended as an antidote to the excruciating fact that, as Joel Spolsky put it, "it's harder to read code than to write it."  Knuth's proposal emphasizes writing code that is comprehensible to human beings, under the thinking that sooner or later programmers other than the author will need to understand it, and that such code will end up being better structured, too.

> > "Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.  The practitioner of literate programming can be regarded as an essayist, whose main concern is with exposition and excellence of style. Such an author, with thesaurus in hand, chooses the names of variables carefully and explains what each variable means.  He or she strives for a program that is comprehensible because its concepts have been introduced in an order that is best for human understanding, using a mixture of formal and informal methods that reinforce each other."
