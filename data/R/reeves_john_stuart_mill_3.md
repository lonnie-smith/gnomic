# On the Narrowness of Benthamite Utility

> Man is never recognized by [Bentham] as being capable of pursuing spiritual perfection as an end; of desiring, for its own sake, the conformity of his own character to his standard of excellence, without hope of good or fear of evil from other source than his own inward consciousness. (137)
