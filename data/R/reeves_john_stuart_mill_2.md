# Mill and Doctrinaire Thought

Mill was, if not precisely a "dialectical" thinker, then certainly one who took very much to heart the idea that he had something valuable to learn from many different schools of thought. He was also actively engaged in politics and punditry, alive to the possibilities of compromise and incremental progress in ways that didn't always sit well with the more doctrinaire political radicals of his day. As a result, 

> Politically, Mill has been claimed by pretty much everyone, from the ethical socialist left to the laissez-faire, libertarian right--and at various points by every major political party. ... It is difficult, however, to size up Mill using the measuring tools of twentieth-century thought. Was he left-wing or right-wing? A progressive or a conservative? For or against state action? An imperialist or anti-colonialist? Elitist or democrat? ... Take your pick. ... He wanted a society in which individuals had the freedom and character necessary to sustain collective life. (8-9)

From Mill's essay on Bentham in the 1838 _London and Westminster Review_:

> [Bentham's] contempt for all other schools of thinkers; his determination to create a philosophy wholly out of the materials furnished by his own mind was his first disqualification as a philosopher. (137)
