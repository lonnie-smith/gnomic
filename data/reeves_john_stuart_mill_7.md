# On Democracy

Mill's ideas about democracy are one area where modern thought has moved way past him, and is possibly looping back around again. In his 1835 review of Tocqueville,

> Mill had warned that the "one and only danger of democracy" was the creation of legislators who were "mere delegates for carrying into execution the preconceived judgment of the majority." He assumed that the working classes would vote for candidates from their own class, who were unlikely to be men of intelligence and wisdom, and would simply pursue class interests. ... [H]e feared the combination of universal suffrage, low levels of education, and a first-past-the-post voting system. (309)

We hear a lot about the tyranny of the majority in the era of Trump--or, to be more exact, the ability of a motivated minority to seize control of one of the two parties and thus exercise power entirely disproportional to their numbers. Concerns about low levels of voter education often floats around the discussions about how democracy functions in modern U.S. elections; partisanship now occupies the position of class in Mill's thinking, modulo some level of mystery around the degree to which our partisan factions are not aligned with economic classes. 

From _Representative Government_ (1861)

> the natural tendency of representative government, as of modern civilization, is towards collective mediocrity; and this tendency is increased by all reductions and extensions in the franchise, their effect being to place the principal power in the hands of classes more and more below the highest levels of instruction in the community ... the great majority of voters would be manual laborers; and the twofold danger, that of too low a standard of political intelligence, and that of class legislation, would exist in a very perilous degree. (310)

Isn't the _point_ of representative democracy to give a voice to class interests or to provide opportunities for class-based legislation? It may be he means the "despotism of the numerical majority," for which reason he was so enthusiastic a proponent of proportional democracy in which "every or any section would be represented, not disproportionately, but proportionally," ensuring a "fair representation of minorities" (311)
