# Browsings

> Close friends, or those in my pay, sometimes call me a literary polymath, while others say that I'm just a shallow dilettante, superficial and breezy, with a faux-naif lifestyle. (222)

Both right, I'm afraid. There is an awful lot of stories about visiting used bookstores and coming home with scads of now-obscure popular fiction from the 19th century and early 20th century. And entire essays devoted to opinions on such edgy topics as "air travel sucks" and "school teachers should be paid more."--I did mark down probably a dozen books to read though, and pulled out _Book by Book_ again.
