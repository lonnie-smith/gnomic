Some emerging themes

* The natural world. It's tractability or trainability--its scrutability--against the symbolic order of human meanings--torn between the mysticism of _Moby Dick_ and the scientist's mechanical or instrumental kinds of knowing.
* Identity and authenticity. Temptation to view T.H. White's character as warped, twisted into an unnatural shape by the pressures of suppressing his sadistic (I'm not sure what she means by this, possibly just "cruel") and homosexual desires--but, also, the role of others in fixing us to an identity; grief as an unmooring from the self defined by the lost other; necessity of finding new fathers and new selves.

On nature and the symbolic order

> When it's fighting a pigeon on your lawn a hawk becomes much larger than life, and bird-book illustrations never match the memory. Here's the sparrowhawk. It's grey, with a black and white barred front, yellow eyes and a long tail. Next to it is the goshawk. This one is also grey, with a black and white barred front, yellow eyes and a long tail ...
>
> In real life, goshawks resemble sparrowhawks the way leopards resemble housecats. Bigger, yes, but bulkier, bloodier, deadlier, and much, much harder to see ... You might spend a week in a forest full fo gosses and never see one, just traces of their presence. A sudden rush, followed by the calls of terrified woodland birds, and a sense of something moving just beyond vision. ... Looking for goshawks is like looking for grace: it comes, but not often, and you don't get to say when or how. (4-5)

Here, the writer's faith in the lyrical imagination to better grasp the world than "bird-book illustrations."

# T. H. White, _The Goshawk_, and _Moby Dick_

> "It would be about the efforts of a second-rate philosopher," he explained, sadly, "who lived alone in the wood; being tired of most humans in any case, to train a person who was not human, but a bird." When I read it again, years after that first childhood encounter, I saw in it more than bad falconry. I understood why people considered it a masterpiece. For White made falconry a metaphysical battle. Like _Moby Dick_ or _The Old Man and the Sea_, _The Goshawk_ was a literary encounter between animal and man that reached back to Puritan traditions of spiritual contest: salvation as a stake to be won in a contest against God. (32-3)

# Nature and Meaning

> I think of what wild animals are in our imaginations. And how they are disappearing--not just form the wild, but from people's everyday lives, replaced by images of themselves in print and on screen. The rarer they get, the fewer meanings animals can have. Eventually, rarity is all they are made of. The condor is an icon of extinction. There's little else to it now but being the last of its kind. And in this lies the diminution of the world. How can you love something, how can you fight to protect it, if all it means is loss? There is a vast difference between my visceral, bloody life with Mabel and the reserved, distanced view of modern nature appreciation. (181)

For White, Gos was

> the dark and immoral child of ancient German forests. He was a murderer. He had all the glamour of the dictator ... he was the violence and irrationality of fascism made flesh [Refers to Nazi use of hawk symbols]. ... Through Gos, he battled the dictator in himself. And for him the hawk was a salutary thing, for he believed that war came from society's repression of innate human urges. Because the hawk could not dissemble he was a "tonic for the less forthright savagery of the human heart." (192-3)

For Macdonald,

> Hunting with the hawk took me to the ery edge of being a human. Then it took me past that place to somewhere I wasn't human at all. ... I saw more than I'd ever seen. The world gathered around me. It made absolute sense. But the only things I knew were hawkish things, and the lines that drew me across the landscape were the lines that drew the hawk: hunger, desire, fascination, the need to find and fly and kill. (195)

But, strangely, violence brings her back to her humanness or moral accountability:

> I was accountable for these deaths. For the first time in my life I wasn't a watcher any more. I was accountable to myself, to the world and all the things in it. But only when I killed. The days were very dark. (197)

> Wild things are made from human histories. When I was a child I hated what White had thought of his goshawk. But Gos's hawkish ghost moved behind the patterend, living feathers of my own. And there were still darker ghosts behind him. (200)
