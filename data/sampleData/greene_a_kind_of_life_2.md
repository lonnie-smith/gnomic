Graham Greene's character is weirdly opaque. He tormented by an emotion he describes as "boredom," which he treats in adolescence with the "drug” of Russian roulette:

> This was not suicide whatever corners jury might've said: it was a gamble with five chances to one against an inquest. The discovery that it was possible to enjoy again the visible world by risking its total loss was one I was bound to make sooner or later. (130)

He plays this game six times before deciding that it has lost its potency. There's some introspection about his motivation—mostly to dispel the idea that it was suicidal in intent—but never goes beyond barely recording is the fact his "boredom”––an affliction he was to suffer throughout life:

> A kind of Russian roulette remained a factor in my later life, so that without previous experience of Africa I went on an absurd and reckless trek through Liberia; it was the fear of boredom which took me two Tabasco during the religious persecution, to a _léproserie_ in the Congo, to the Kikuyu reserve during the Mau Mau insurrection, to the emergency in Malaysia and to the French war in Vietnam. There, in those three regions of clandestine war, the fear of ambush served me just as effectively as the revolver from the corner cupboard in the lifelong war against boredom. (133)

At one point, he fix it too thick and has a dentist extract a perfectly good tooth under ether:

> A few minutes unconsciousness was like a holiday from the world. I had lost a good tooth, but the boredom was for the time being dispersed. (158)

A desire to escape from boredom doesn't really seem adequate as a motivation for this sort of thing, yet the emotion or impulse isn’t really described, yet alone questioned or explained. Graham Greene describes his motive for writing the book as

> much the same motive that has made me a novelist: a desire to reduce a class of experience to some sort of order, and a hungry curiosity. We cannot love others, so the theologians teach, unless in some degree we can love ourselves, and curiosity too begins at home. (12)

If so, the book seems kind of deficient in respect of curiosity.
