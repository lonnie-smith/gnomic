Lying in a hospital ward recovering from an appendectomy, Greene gathers "material" watching a 10-year-old boy die of complications from a broken leg.

> There is a splinter of ice in the heart of a writer. I watched and listened. This was something which one day I might need: the woman [boy's mother] speaking, uttering the banalities she must have remembered from some women's magazine, a genuine grief that could only communicate in clichés. "My boy, my boy, why did you not wait till I came?" The father sat silent with his hat on his knees, and you could tell that even in his unhappiness he was embarrassed by the banality of his wife's words, by the scene she was so badly playing to the public ward, and he wanted desperately to get away home and be alone. "Human language", Flaubert wrote, "is like a cracked kettle on which we beat out tunes for bears to dance to, when all the time we are longing to move the stars to pity." (188-9)

A weird combination of contempt (he almost sides with the father), a journalist's chilly observational distance, and a warmer human sympathy recognizing the inadequacy of words--even Flaubert's--to encompass experience.
