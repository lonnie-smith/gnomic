It hasn't got much in the way of plots. Or, maybe it does, but the arc is so slow--stretching out over 12 novels-- that it just isn't all that readily perceived 300 pages in? Either way, this is the sort of book where you set up and take notice when the plot marches forward slightly with a sentence like "The minutes past: the conversation flagged." It's like sitting in traffic.

Another odd thing––it's all middle. You’re plunged into the middle of the narrator's reverie on page 1, and rarely come up for air before you’re plunged into the next.

> Nothing establishes the timelessness of Time like those episodes of early experience seen, on reexamination examination at a later period, do have been crowded together with such unbelievable closeness in the  of a few years; yet equally giving the illusion of being so intimately extended during the months when actually taking place .(Bk 2, p. 23)

The narrator's posture is weird, not really very realistic (naturalistic?)—It's hard to believe anyone capable of that kind of focused observation; it makes the first person narration a bit strained; the all-knowing stance might be a little less odd as more of an authorial posture, classic satirical eye on others’ foibles of manner?
