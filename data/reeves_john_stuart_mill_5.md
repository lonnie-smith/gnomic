# On the Triumph of Equal Opportunity

So much do we take them for granted that none of Mill's big ideas are, today, are what you could call counterintuitive or revolutionary-sounding or even especially inspiring. The idea of "equal opportunity" is now so integral to our shared ethical framework that even those who oppose it in practice pay lip service to the idea. 

It's difficult appreciate the idea of equal opportunity as being as threateningly radical as it was. I wish Reeves had given us a bit more on the intellectual environment in which Mill was working; I think maybe Reeves assumes that the flavor and substance of the reactionary argument is more familiar than it is. One counterexample is James Fitzjames Stevens' reaction to Mill's call for "perfect equality" in education:

> "Are girls and boys to be instructed in the same things?" he demanded of Mill. "Are boys to learn to sew, to keep house, and to cook, and girls to play at cricket, to row; and be drilled like boys?" he sputtered, before going on to prove Mill's point about irrational prejudices: "I cannot argue with a person who says yes." (421)
