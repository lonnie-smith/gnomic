# Mill on Character and Political Action

Writing on the Irish potato famine in 1846:

> What was needed was a reform which "must be something operating upon the minds of the people and not merely upon their stomachs ... they must have something to strive for, some rational ambition." As so often, [Mill] was concerned with the _improvement of character_: "You will never change the people but by changing the external motives which act on them, and shape their way of life from the cradle to the grave." (180)

Reeves at times elides the stark difference between Mill's focus on individual character and what modern political thinkers concerned with social justice might call empowerment (he says that Mill's concern is with "how to build democratic and civic institutions which "empower"--in other words, build the characters of--citizens"), but with respect to the Famine, Reeves draws out the distinction a bit better, calling Mill

> as guilty as most of the political class in his underestimation of the pressing needs of the Irish nation, and guiltier than most in his overestimation of the danger of dependency--certainly compared, at any rate, to the danger of death. (182)

This is another one of those areas in which it's difficult to fit Mill into modern political taxonomies--a concern with individual character as a determinant of fate is strongly coded as right-wing now, while an emphasis on material conditions is coded as left-wing. Something potentially useful about Mill's perspective is that he doesn't appear to recognize a distinction between material conditions and individual character: institutions and "external motives" shape culture.
