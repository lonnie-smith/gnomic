The flavor of this is a bit Austen, but without the marriage plot. The narrative voice is much sharper, more perceptive, more archly pitiless, than the heroine.

As with Austen, that voice really complicates the book's politics. The 1999 New York Review of Books edition is packaged with an introduction by Alison Lurie, which presents the book as a kind of first-wave feminist prequel to _A Room of One's Own_, but I don't think that reading is fully attentive to the fact that Laura is not a character we're meant to take entirely seriously. We're meant to feel the burden of Lolly in taking up "a woman's place," and her desire to "have a life of one's own, not an existence doled out to you by others," but, on the other hand, Lolly isn't exactly a tragic or heroic figure. For instance, why make the condition of Lolly's passivity both faintly amusing and a core element of her character? Whatever this might be, it isn't an uncomplicated, 100% earnest essay arguing that well-to-do women need to have more power to determine the shape of their lives. It is that at times, but it's cut with too many weird reticences and ambiguities.
