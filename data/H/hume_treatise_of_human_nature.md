# On Rigor and Skepticism

While a warm imagination is allow'd to enter into philosophy, and hypotheses embrac'd merely for being specious and agreeable, we can never have any steady principles, nor any sentiments, which will suit with common practice and experience. But were these hypotheses once removed, we might hope to establish a system or set of opinions, which if not true (for that, perhaps, is too much to be hop'd for) might at least be satisfactory to the human mind, and might stand the test of the most critical examination. Nor should we despair of attaining this end, because of the many chimerical systems, which have successively arisen, and decay'd away among men, would we consider the shortness of that period, wherein those questions have been the subjects of enquiry and reasoning. (272-3)

> We have, therefore, no choice left but betwixt a false reason and none at all. (267)
