# On What Pop Music Does to the Teenage Psyche

The memorable passage from _High Fidelity_ about the probable effects of pop
music on the teenage psyche:

> What came first--the music or the misery?  Did I listen to music because I was miserable?  Or was I miserable because I listened to music?  Do all those records turn you into a melancholy person?
>
> People worry about kids playing with guns, and teenagers watching violent videos; we are scared that some sort of culture of violence will take them over.  Nobody worries about kids listening to thousands--literally thousands--of songs about broken hearts and rejection and pain and misery and loss.  The unhappiest people I know, romantically speaking, are the ones who like pop music the most; and I don't know whether pop music has caused this unhappiness, but I do know that they've been listening to the sad songs longer than they've been living the unhappy lives.  (24-5)
