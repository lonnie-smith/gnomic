# On Shallow and Abstruse Thinkers

This from the beginning of Hume's essay on commerce (253-4).

> The greater part of mankind may be divided into two classes; that of _shallow_ thinkers, who fall short of the truth; and that of _abstruse_ thinkers, who go beyond it.  The latter class are by far the most rare: and I may add, by far the most useful and valuable.  They suggest hints, at least, and start difficulties, which they want, perhaps, skill to pursue; but which may produce fine discoveries, when handled by men who have a more just way of thinking.  At worst, what they say is uncommon; and if it should cost some pains to comprehend it, one has, however, the pleasure of hearing something that is new.  An author is little to be valued, who tells us nothing but what we can learn from every coffee-house conversation.

> All people of _shallow_ thought are apt to decry even those of _solid_ understanding, as _abstruse_ thinkers, and metaphysicians, and refiners; and never will allow any thing to be just which is beyond their own weak conceptions.  There are some cases, I own, where an extraordinary refinement affords a strong presumption of falsehood, and where no reasoning is to be trusted but what is natural and easy.  When a man deliberates concerning his conduct in any _particular_ affair, and forms schemes in politics, trade, oeconomy, or any business in life, he never ought to draw his arguments too fine, or connect too long a chain of consequences together.  Something is sure to happen, that will disconcert his reasoning, and produce an event different from what he expected.  But when we reason upon _general_ subjects, one may justly affirm, that our speculations can scarcely ever be too fine, provided they be just; and that the difference between a common man and a man of genius is chiefly seen in the shallowness or depth of the principles upon which they proceed.
