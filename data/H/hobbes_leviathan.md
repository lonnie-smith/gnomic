# On the Infinite and Human Understanding

> When we say anything is infinite, we signifie onely, that we are not able to conceive the ends, and bounds, of the thing named; and having no Conception of the thing, but of our own inability. And therefore the Name of _God_ is used, not to make us conceive him; (for he is _Incomprehensible_; and his greatnesse, and power are unconceivable;) but that we may honour him. (23, ch. 3)
