# The Wild is not a panacea.

> I'd thought that to heal my great hurt, I should flee to the wild. It was what people did. The nature books I'd read told me so. So many of them had been  inspired by grief or sadness. ... "Nature, in her green, tranquil woods heals and soothes all afflictions," wrote John Muir. "Earth hath no sorrows that earth cannot heal."

> Now I knew this for what it was: a beguiling but dangerous lie. I was furious with myself and my own unconscious certainty that this was the ure I needed. Hands are for other human hands to hold. They should not be reserved exclusively as perches for hawks. And the wild is not a panacea for the human soul; too much in the air can corrode it to nothing. (218)

> In hunting with Mabel, day after day, I had assumed--in my imagination, of course, but that was all it could ever be--her alien perspective, her inhuman understanding of the world. It brought something akin to madness and I did not understand what I had done. When I was small I thought turning into a hawk would be a magical thing. What I'd read in _The Sword and the Stone_ encouraged me to think it, too, as a good and instructive thing; a lesson in life for a child that would be king. But now the lesson was killing me. It was not all the same. (212)

> Old England is an imaginary place, a landscape built from words, woodcuts, films, paintings, picturesque engravings. It is a place imagined by people, and people do not live very long or look very hard. We are very bad at scale. The things that live in the soil are too small to care about; climate change too large to imagine. We are bad at time, too. We cannot remember what lived here before we did; we cannot love what is not. Nor can we imagine what will be different when we are dead. We take solace in pictures and we wipe the hills of history. (265)

In an odd way, the nature book is an odd inversion of the lyrical realist novel--Zadie Smith's essay on two paths for the novel--the founding myth of lyrical realism is that "the self is a bottomless pool. What you cannot find in the heavens (anymore), you find in the soul. Yet there remains ... a great anxiety about the depth ... of the soul in question"

"Heavens" here is a metaphor for religious transcendence, but echoes nicely with the idea of falconry having once been thought an improving activity because it had you always training your eyes on the heavens.

Nature books as relentlessly turn outwards for meanings--"meaning" as therapeutic, as healing, of a wholeness that, critically, affects understanding as much as emotion--"the world gathered around me. It made absolute sense"--in contrast to the dissolution of grief, or of depression, where meanings and things don't hold together anymore.

_H is for Hawk (2015)_ is about discovering that nature is other than we have imagined it to be, including its supposed therapeutic virtues. But it is alos about examining, questioning, sometimes loving, or mourning, or despising the meanings we ascribe to nature, and about the danger those imaginary natures pose. I suppose their power to occlude what's really there--not because what's really there transcends the "imaginary" (the symbolic order of human meanings), but simply because these images construct what we can see, or forclose possibilities, or displace ideas that are more important, wiping the hills of history.

Thoreau's _Walden_ is a kind of ur-text for the therapeutic uses of nature. In his formulation, it's subsistence living, living "simply" and unencumbered by human society. Weird that Macdonald doesn't mention this book. maybe because she's British?
