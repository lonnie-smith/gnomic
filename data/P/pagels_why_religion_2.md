# On Syncretism in Wiliam James and the Gnostic Texts

> Some of the books found at Nag Hammadi include a similar scattershot range of sources, often bound into the same volumes. Like William James, the second-century Christian author of the _Gospel of Philip_ observes that people of different temperaments, situations, and levels of insight need different spiritual "food." And just as James turns from Whitman's poems to Stoic philosophy, whoever compiled Nag Hammadi's sixth book placed the poem called _Thunder_ next to a passsage from Plato's _Republic_. Yet while William James focues primarily on Christian sources, and tends to ignore collective and ritual aspects of religious experience, some of these ancient scribes embraced a far wider cultural range, apparently less concerned, as we've seen, with _belief_ than with _approaches to spiritual practice_. For then, as now, city people and travelers lived in a cosmopolitan world, in which the second-centruy Greek-speaking Christian in Rome named Hippolytus knew of "naked Hindus by the Ganges," whom he called "heretics." At the same time, Indian sculptors were producing images of the Buddha influenced by the conventions of Greek sculptors; and the author of _Allogenes_, perhaps jewish, may have incorporated a Buddhist practice into his “revelation.“ And although I think it’s extremely unlikely that Jesus spent his “lost years“ in India, as some people like to speculate, Syrian Christian tradition suggests that the apostle Thomas brought Jesus‘s teachings to India, where Hindu or Buddhist teaching may have influenced some sayings now found in the _Gospel of Thomas_.
