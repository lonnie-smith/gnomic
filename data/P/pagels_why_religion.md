Part spiritual autobiography, part grief memoir; Pagels' careful, plainspoken prose reminds me of Patti Smith's writing in _Just Kids_


# On the Cruelty of Orthodox Christian Theology

Pagels struggling with the bone-deep cruelty of the Orthodox Christian theology of "Christ Crucified"

> [a friend], the daughter of evangelical missionaries, called me after seeing the film _The Passion of the Christ_ to tell me that she'd wept through Mel Gibson's graphic, endless scenes of torture, since they showed "how much God loves us."
>
> Startled, I wondered, What kind of God lives in her imagination? An all-powerful god who cannot, or will not, forgive human sin unless an innocent person--his own beloved son--is horribly tortured and slaughtered? Christians who preach that message also have to persuade potential converts that they are hopeless sinners, deservedly dangling over the fires of eternal torment ... Both Catholic and Protestant theologians, from Anselm through Martin Luther, adopted Augustine's views [on original sin], which he pictured as a sexually transmitted _moral_ disease, perhaps because they enabled each of them to claim that only his church could "save you." Evangelicals at Peninsula Bible Church in Palo Alto, where I'd gone as an adolescent, liked to repeat a perspective they often claim derives from the Hebrew Bible, "Without the shedding of blood there is no remission," almost singing the words, often earnest, sometimes smug, declaring that since "God so loved the world that he gave his only son to die for the sins of the world," you must "accept Jesus as your savior" or be damned.

> Since this is message that many proclaim, why not look elsewhere and abandon Christianity? I'd done that, and might never have returned for a deeper look had it not been for the secret gospels. Only much later did I realize that the formula basic to later Christian creeds ("Christ died for our sins") goes back to the apostle Paul--not, of course, to Jesus. What, then, did Paul preach as "good news"? Writing to converts in the Greek city of Corinth about twenty years after Jesus's death, he summed it up like this:
>
> > _Christ died for our sins . . . he was buried, and raised after three days, then appeared to Peter, then to the twelve, then to more than five hundred believers at once. . . . :ast of all, he appeared to me.
>
> Ever since leaving that evangelical church in Palo Alto, where Christians read Paul's letters as "God's word," I've disliked reading them. Although sometimes he writes powerfully, even poetically, often his tone is intensely domineering. His letters read as passionately written manifestoes of an intense, impulsive, and brilliant missionary, bent on telling people what to believe and how to behave. Although he'd never met Jesus during his lifetime, Paul contemptuously dismissed those who had, angrily cursing even those who had known "the Lord" best--his closest disciple, Peter, and Jesus's own brother James--when they disagreed with him about Jesus's message. But since Paul wrote his letters decades before others wrote gospels, and his recipients in Greece and Turkey copied them widely and sent them to potential converts all over the known world, they became primary documents of the early movement, his slogan "Christ crucified" often taken as the basic statement of the Gospel.
>
> Recently, though, in the _Gospel of Truth_ found at Nag Hammadi, I discovered a different Paul--and a different message. It's anonymous author, most likely Valentinus, the Egyptian poet and visionary, who admires Paul, sees the apostle as teacher of secret wisdom whose vision of grace includes everyone. Having carefully read the letters of Paul now in the New Testament, this author writes what he calls "the true gospel" to answer a question that Paul leaves dangling in his famous first letter to the Corinthians.

There, Paul, attempting to unify competing factions, he decided to preach nothing but "Jesus Christ crucified," a simpleminded message that he knew would sound foolish to educated people, but

> Paul hastens to add that he's not preaching this simpleminded message because it's all that he knows. On the contrary, he says, he _does_ teach secret wisdom to those who are spiritually mature.
>
> > We do teach wisdom among people who are mature--not the wisdom of this world, nor of the rulers of his age. Rather, _we speak of the wisdom of God hidden in mystery, which God foreordained before the ages for our glory--which none of the rulers of this age kne--for, had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
>
> I was intrigued to see that here, in his own words Paul hints at a different version of the gospel--not that God "sent his own son to die" as a human sacrifice, but that ignorant and violent people, or the spiritual powers that energized them, had killed Jesus. Yet he then goes on to say that despite their malice, this awful event concealed a mystery. Surely he intended his mysterious words to raise intense curiosity: What, or who, _is_ that primordial "wisdom of God, hidden in mystery"--secret wisdom, unknown even to the most powerful people in the world? And why does Paul refuse to tell them?
>
> ... I realized that the anonymous author of _The Gospel of Truth_ writes to answer that question, and to reveal that secret wisdom--or, at least, his version of it.
