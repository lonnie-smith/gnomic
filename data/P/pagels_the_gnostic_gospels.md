# On Gnostic Christianity

The book is a sort of alternate history of the first- and second-century church, as suggested by the discovery of a cache of "heretical" Coptic texts discovered at Nag Hammadi in 1945.

These texts reveal a far more heterodox Christian practice before the consolidation of orthodoxy in the second and third centuries, one that was, for example, comparatively open to influence from Greek and Indian spiritual traditions, and that contested some of the core tenants of orthodox Christianity. Pagels emphasizes the following as central features of gnostic flavors of Christianity that were eventually suppressed.

* Rejection of priestly authority, or maybe spiritual authority more generally, seeing the individual’s pursuit of “gnosis” as a solitary pursuit.
* Emphasis on spiritual seeking, leading to a naturally more heterodox vision of spiritual practice than what later became Orthodox christianity. Orthodox creeds, with their emphasis on correct belief, emerge in large part in the attempt to purify the church from heretical gnostic elements. The Nag Hammadi texts, which include a pretty wide variety of materials, some of them not recognizably Christian, suggest that early Christianity may have been far more fluid than you might think.
* A kind of spiritual elitism, often concerned with distinguishing the spiritually enlightened from the unenlightened (contrast to Orthodoxy’s attitude, which was that the church’s teachings needed to be easy for everyone to understand)

> [The gnostic emphasis on solitude] derives from the gnostics’ insistence on the primacy of immediate experience. No one else can tell another which way to go, what to do, how to act. The gnostic could not accept on faith what others said, except as a provisional measure, until one found one’s own path, “for,” as the gnostic teacher Heracleon says, “people at first are led to believe in the Savior through others,” but when they become mature “they no longer rely on mere human testimony,” but discover instead their own immediate relationship with “the truth itself.” Whoever follows secondhand testimony—even testimony of the apostles and the Scriptures—could earn the rebuke Jesus delivered to his disciples when they quoted the prophets to him: “You have ignored the one living in your presence and have spoken (only) of the dead.” Only own the basis of immediate experience could one create the poems, vision accounts, myths, and hymns that gnostics prized as proof that one actually has attained gnosis.
