# On Introverts and Society as Consolation

> Society and conversation, therefore, are the most powerful remedies for restoring the mind to its tranquility, if, at any time, it has unfortunately lost it; as well as the best preservatives of that equal and happy temper, which is so necessary to self-satisfaction and enjoyment. Men of retirement and speculation, who are apt to sit brooding at home over either grief or resentment, though they may often have more humanity, more generosity, and a nicer sense of honour, yet seldom possess that equality of temper which is so common among men of the world. (23)

# On Love and Virtue

> To be amiable and to be meritoriousl that is, to deserve love and to deserve reward, ar the great characters of virtue; and to be odious and punishable, vice. ... Virtue is not said to be amiable, or to be meritorious, because it is the object of its own love, or of its own gratitude; but because it excites those sentiments in other men. ... What so great happiness as to be beloved, and to know that we deserve to be loved? What so great misery as to be hated, and to know that we deserve to be hated? (p. 113)
