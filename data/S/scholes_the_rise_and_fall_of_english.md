# On What Society Wants from its Humanities Graduates

> What this society _wants_ of those who graduate from its schools and colleges with degrees in the humanities--as opposed to what many of those who claim to speak for it _say_ it wants--are, at worst, docility and grammatical competence, at best, reliability and a high level of textual skills. What this society does _not_ want from our educational institutions is a group of people imbued with critical skills and values that are frankly antagonistic to those that prevail in our marketplace, courts, and legislative bodies. (19)

Of course, what Scholes doesn't mention is that probably society doesn't really want humanities graduates for much of anything--docility and textual skills, after all, may be picked up as easily along with some more useful body of professional skills.
