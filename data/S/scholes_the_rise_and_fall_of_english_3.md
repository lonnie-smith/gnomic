# On English as a Discipline, as Opposed to a Subject

> The one thing a curriculum in English _must_ do, whatever else it accomplishes on the way, is to lead students to a position of justified confidence in their own competence as textual consumers and their own eloquence as producers of texts. (66)

> For too long, we have designed curricula in order to do justice to what we perceived as our subject matter. What I am suggesting is that we stop thinking of ourselves as if we had a subject matter and start thinking of ourselves as having a discipline which we can offer our students as part of the cultural equipment that they are going to need when they leave us. (67-8)
