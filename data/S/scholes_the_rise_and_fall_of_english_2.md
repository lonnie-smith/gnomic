# On Teaching and the Love of Truth

> I believe that, if we teachers of the humanities cannot claim what my other Victorian sage called the "love of truth" as part of our enterprise, that enterprise is in serious trouble. To sharpen the focus a bit, I believe that we are in trouble precisely because we have allowed ourselves to be persuaded that we cannot make truth claims but must go on "professing" just the same. ... Powerful voices in our field have taught us to be embarrassed by the word _truth_ and thus either to avoid it or condemn it. (39)

> We are driven to an extraordinary extent by these two forces--fashion and the marketplace. We live in an academic world in which we are rewarded not so much according to how well we teach or how much we learn but by the amount we publish and the attention it attracts from others. Instead of the search for truth, what we have is a conversation in which the rewards go the the best conversationalists. (48)

> We need the sense of a shared enterprise, to which we may contribute something. As educators, we need the sense that we are presenting to students and colleagues ideas, methods, and information that are neither false nor useless. We need reasons for believing in our beliefs. (54)


# On "Hypocriticm" and Professionalism

> Hypocriticism is simply the critical practice of people who must go through the motions developed by evangelical teachers like Billy Phelps without the faith that animated Phelps himself, who knows less literature than Phelps did because they must know more critical theory and can't, after all, know everything, and who have lost faith in the possibility of either themselves or the books they "profess" telling the truth about anything important in the lives of those they are teaching. (81)

(Phelps is Scholes' archetypical 1930s English Teacher, proclaiming literature as a new scripture.)

> With every additional subdivision [of the discipline]--each of which makes sense within the logic of professionalism--we are driven deeper and deeper into hypocriticism for every move toward greater specialization leads us away from the needs of a majority of our students and drives a wedge between our professional lives and our own private needs and concerns. (82)

Scholes talks a lot about the old/lingering sense of English teachers being "exegetes of quasi-religious texts" (84), but I wonder if this is only a rhetorical strategy to cast aspersion on emotive ("evangelical") pedagogy by calling it by the suspect name of religion. What's at issue is the idea that the meanings in or derived from texts are at least potentially "meaningful," in an uncomplicated way, to those who read them. What's wrong with this? Scholes seems to think that looking for this sort of meaning is a "serious aesthetic pursuit" requiring the sort of free time and mental energy available only to the privileged. (77) 

# On Research and Teaching

> In the sciences, research receives its justification and its support--despite all the lip service to "pure" knowledge--from exploitable discoveries or patents to which it may lead. In the humanities, research receives its justification--despite all the lip service to the advancement of learning-from its applicability to teaching. In fact, I would argue that all important research in the humanities is simply teaching by other means than the lecture or the seminar. And conversely, published work in English studies that has no use in teaching or makes no contribution to learning is unimportant--trifling stuff. ... Learning and teaching justify one another and support one another. But the pressure for research in English is often in direct conflict with both learning and teaching. And that is a formula for academic disaster--a disaster that is most obvious and most pressing in the situation of graduate studies in English. (172-3).
