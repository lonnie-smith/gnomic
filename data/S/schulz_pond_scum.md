# On nature writing & nature as therapy

Kathryn Schulz's takedown of Thoreau in the _New Yorker_ has it that Thoreau's supposed love of nature is mostly an egotistical misanthropy, a "comprehensive arrogance"--"Thoreau's antipathy towards humanity even encompassed the very idea of civilization," which he views as "a contaminant."

> Like his fellow transcendentalists, he was suspicious of tradition and institutions, and regarded personal intution and direct revelations as superior foundations for both spiritual and secular beliefs.

Thoreau's interest in nature seems mostly to do with isolation, solitude--nature is where you go to "construct a life on the basis of ethical and existential first principles"--a kind of blank slate from which to work, uncontaminated.

> It is also in contemplating the land that Thoreau got the big picture right. "We can never have enough of nature," he wrote. "We need to witness our own limits transgressed, and some time pasturing freely where we never wander." ... He understood why the wilderness matters, and he was right that there is something salutary, liberating, and exhilirating about living in it with as little as necessary.
