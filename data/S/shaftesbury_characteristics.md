# On Trust

> Impostors naturally speak the best of human nature that they may the easier abuse it. ... For it is opinion of goodness which creates easiness of trust, and by trust we are betrayed to power, our very reason thus being captivated by those in whom we come insensibly to have an implicit faith. (from "Sensus Communis", pg. 44)
