# On Professional Degree Programs for Software Developers

> Consider this quote: "People who studied poetry, physics, or civil engineering are often better software engineers than an MIT CS graduate (contrast with medicine; not too many good doctors out there who skipped med school)." This comparison is invalid; there are, in fact, many very good physicians who studied poetry, physics, or civil engineering as undergraduates. Medical schools provide a professional graduate degree program in a practical field. Where is the analogous professional degree program for software developers?

> That's right, there isn't one (for those who suggested the "software engineering" graduate degree at CMU, put your hands down). So, let's take the above comparison to its correct logical conclusion.

> Developing software and providing medical care have similarities. Both are complex processes that require a great deal of technical knowledge, as well as the ability to apply that knowledge in various and frequently changing circumstances. In the practice of both, human factors such as communication and cooperation often outweigh the importance of all else. To this end, medicine (like most applied professions) has distinguished itself from its scientific roots. Undergraduates study the scientific fundamentals -- biology, chemistry, physics, etc. -- and with this background then choose their career path. Those who choose theory and science go to PhD programs; those who choose application go to MD programs, which emphasize practical skills and hands-on work.

> The software industry needs to wake up and take a lesson from its older brethren. Computer science is useful stuff; people who choose to write software professionally should be familiar with it. But, realistically, an undergraduate CS program teaches only the scientific underpinnings of software development. Upon completing a CS degree, students who choose the path of science and theory can continue on to a PhD program; the vast majority who choose the applied path have nowhere to go but industry, for which they are woefully unprepared. Who do they learn the skills they actually need from? The people already working at their company; who learned those skills from their predecessors; who learned... etc.
