# On Identity Politics and Left Discourse

> As everyone on the left knows, the concept of political correctness was formulated within left discourse itself to critique the tendency to moralistic posturing provoked by the dire situation of an increasingly reactionary social order. The usefulness of that concept is certainly at an end, bu t one may continue to spead of "identity politics" or what I would call "radical liberalism," a specific style of political discourse and practice distinct from the historical forms of socialism and Marxism. The argument of this chapter with liberalism, both traditional and radical, is not with any of its progressive objectives, but with those assumptions of its theory and practice which, because they are uncritically shared with American political culture in general, have disabled an effective response to the resurgence of reactionary politics. Taking the long view historically, there is considerable evidence for arguing that "identity politics" _is_ now American politics, and that what we call identity politics exists on the same continuum of "interest group" politics with positions that are manifestly conservative or reactionary. Identity politics makes no conceptual break as a _politics_ with its precursors, even in its radical forms. (343, note to pg. 4)

# On Representation of Social Identities and Material Reality

> The idealism of this [liberal pluralist] critique [of the canon] consists in the belief that in order to change the world it is only necessary to change our image of the world. This is a question not of the reality of images but of the virtual absence of economic or class analysis in liberal pluralist theory. The absence of such analysis permits First World pluralists to construe the question of postcolonialism, for example, primarily as one of rehabilitating our images of the native cultures and identities of postcolonial populations, a program that does not even begin to address the steadily worsening effects of ... the "capitalist world system." (345, note to pg. 8)

> One can easily concede that there must be _some_ relation between the representation of minorities in positions of power and the representations of minorities in the canon, but what is that relation? ... But in construing the process of canon formation as an exclusionary process essentially the same as the exclusion of socially defined minorities from power aims to reconstruct it as a true image (a true representation) of social diversity. (7-8)

Or, more succinctly,

> If liberal pluralism has discovered that the cultural is also always the political (which it is), it has seldom escaped the trap of reducing the political to the cultural. (13)

Adjustments to the canon to allow broader representation is a concrete example of what Guillory means by reducing the political to the cultural:

> Those who have never been taught ... the _practice_ of reading have little occasion to rejoice at their being "represented" in the canon. Such representation does not address or compensate for the socioeconomic conditions of their existence so long as the school continues to distribute cultural capital unequally. (38)

# Critique of Identity as a Basis for Radical Politics

The gist here is that identity politics tends to reduce politics to the "expression of oppressed subjectivities" rather than a more traditional Marxist-style analysis of the basis of oppression--thinking about how people experience oppression, as opposed to thinking about what causes the oppression.

> Claiming an "identity" on the basis of a specific oppression is seen here as the ground for a wholly new kind of politics, for which the affirmation and validation of experiences of "difference" are at least as important as the analysis of the basis of oppression and its location within the perspective of a wider oppositional movement--if not more so. On this model, oppressed social identities are transformed _directly_ into oppositional political identities through a celebration of difference which inverts the prevailing structure of value but leaves the structure of differences untouched.
>
> ... the problem with [this] position is that it tends to reduce radical politics to the expression of oppressed subjectivities, and thereby to lead to the construction of moralistic, and often simply additive "hierarchies of oppression," whereby the political significance attributed to the views of particular individuals is proportional to the sum of their oppressions. Such a tendency both positively encourages a fragmentation of political agency and harbours the danger of exacerbating conflicts between oppressed groups. (12-13)

There's a whiff of defensiveness here; why wouldn't subjectivist accounts of oppression naturally complement more analytically-oriented radicalism?
