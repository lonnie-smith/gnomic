# On Common Minds

From a conversation early in the novel between Celia and Dorothea, regarding
Mr. Casaubon's virtues; Celia is complaining about Causaubon's blinking and spoon-scraping:

>"Celia," said Dorothea with emphatic gravity, "pray don't make any more observations of that kind."
>
> "Why not?  They are quite true," returned Celia, who had her reasons for persevering, though she was beginning to be a little afraid.
>
> "Many things are true which only the commonest minds observe."
>
> "Then I think the commonest minds must be rather useful.  I think it is a pity Mr. Casaubon's mother had not a commoner mind: she might have taught him better." (66)
