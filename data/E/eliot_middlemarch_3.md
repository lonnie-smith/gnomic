The narrator's rumination on Will Ladislaw's rather vague expectations of
attaining greatness

> Even Caesar's fortune at one time was but a grand presentiment.  We know what a masquerade all development is, and what effective shapes may be disguised in helpless embryos.--In fact, the world is full of hopeful analogies and handsome dubious eggs called possibilities. (93)

(compare "Will's generous reliance on the intentions of the universe with regard to himself" with the kind of harsh light the narrator shines on Fred Vincy's unbounded optimism)
