# On Hardy's Atheism

> Hardy knew his countrymen's capacity for respectable self-delusion, for the kind of mendacity that considers God's foe "essentially Christian."  Indeed he was not so much interested in persuading honest believers to abandon their beliefs as in shaming an already agnostic century into admitting the depths of its uncertainty.  His novels, and especially his poems, describe a world from which God has already absconded and for good.  Because this is still the world we inhabit today, he remains one of the most vital and relevant of English writers--more modern, in some ways, than the modernists who succeeded and disdained him. (74)

> In all areas except the intellectual, he conceded, he was a late bloomer: "a child until he was sixteen, a youth till he was five-and-twenty, and a young man till he was nearly fifty."  (76, quoting Hardy's autobiography)
