# On Narrative Fiction and Memoir

It's not an experience like any other fiction I've read. Ordinarily, details are included for a reason. I'm always catching myself trying to treat an incident as meaningful--as thematically motivated or as setting up the next beat in the narrative. Only, I think what he's going for here isn't actually a narrative, isn't a story at all, at least not in the customary sense. There's a tension between "narrative" and "life" that pops out late in book 2:

> Fictional writing has no value, documentary narrative has no value. The only genres I saw value in, which still conferred meaning, were diaries and essays, the types of literature that did not deal with narrative, that were not about anything, but just consisted of a voice, the voice of your own personality, a life, a face, a gaze you could meet.
