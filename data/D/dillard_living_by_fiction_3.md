# On the Relative Status of Novels and Nonfiction

> Mailer's calling this documentary account of the life and death of convict Gary Gilmore a novel seems to say, this text is meaningful, it is a work of art. The cultural assumption is that the novel is the proper home of significance and that nonfiction is mere journalism. This is interesting because it means that in two centuries our assumptions have been reversed; if you wanted to write significant literature--if you wanted to do art or make an object from ideas--you wrote nonfiction. We now think of nonfiction as sincere and artless. ... Now the novel is seen as the literary form, the art form. This is actually great news, for which we have to thank generations of serious novelists ... Less great are its implications for nonfiction. (83)
