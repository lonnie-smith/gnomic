# On Criticism and Interpreting the "Raw World"

> Critics, then, interpret neither the natural world nor the cultural world directly. Critics can discuss a whale or a bottle rack only if Melville or a Duchamp has already selected and stilled these objects. All this is, I'm afraid, self-evident to almost everyone but a very few people, to whom it comes as a continuous shock and disappointment.

> Can we not loose the methods of literary criticism upon the raw world? May we not analyze the breadth of our experience? We can and may--but only if we first consider the raw world as a text, as a meaningful, purposefully fashioned creation, as a work of art. For we have seen that critics interpret artifacts only. Our interpreting the universe as an artifact absolutely requires that we posit an author for it, or a celestial filmmaker, dramatist, painter, sculptor, composer, architect, or choreographer. And no one has been willing openly to posit such an artist for the universe since the American Transcendentalists and before them the Medieval European philosophers. (144)

This is a succinct description of Dillard's own nonfiction practice in, for example, _Holy the Firm_ or _Pilgrim at Tinker Creek_--to play the role of the critic of the "raw world"

# On Literature as Criticism of the Raw World

> It is very interesting to consider literature this way: as a formal assignment of meaning to many things, as a kind of interpretive criticism with the great world as its object. (147)

Poetry, in particular, functions this way:

> Poetry's materials, its characters, objects, and events ... are far more likely to have been actual than fabricated. This means that poetry has been able to function quite directly as human interpretation of the raw, loose universe. ... It is a shame that poetry has decayed to such sensory self-indulgence that it has abdicated that task to which it is so well and uniquely suited. (147)

# On Art as Epistemological Practice

> Art and religion probe the mysteries in those difficult areas where blurred and powerful symbols are the only possible speech and their arrangement into coherent religions and works of art are the only possible grammar. (164)

> ... art, especially insofar as it is symbolic art, is not only an object of past knowledge but an instrument of new knowledge. For if you already understood all the relationships among phenomena to which the parts of your art referred, you could control them easily from the start--and you cannot. It is the artist's business, then, to learn from his art and to order more formally his new understanding ... When in the art object the artist has mastered his own confusion, he has gained new ground; and if he is mature enough and dedicated enough to have begun at the far edge of his own culture's knowledge, then he has won new ground not only for himself but for his culture as well.
