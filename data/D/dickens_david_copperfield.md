# On Being at One's Own Disposal

Here's David, on leaving Dr. Strong's School:

> Misty ideas of being a young man at my own disposal, of the wonderful things to be seen and done by that magnificent animal, and the wonderful effects he could not fail to make upon society, lured me away. So powerful were these visionary considerations in my boyish mind, that I seem, according to my present way of thinking, to have left school without regret. (258)
