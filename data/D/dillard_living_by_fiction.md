# On Materialism in Nineteenth-Century Realism

> Central characters in the Stendhal novel, the Dickens novel, the James novel, interest themselves in blood, money, and advancement to an extent that is simply staggering to anyone who approaches literature through formal methods appropriate to modernism. Where is the art? Where is the metaphysics? These characters, and presumably their authors as well, are more interested in man's cash assets than in his bargainings with eternity. Conflict, in such novels seldom, if ever, erupts between people and whales. At the European novel's close, characters do not, as in the American novel, ride off alone into the sunset. Instead, they are drawn off together in carriages to the bank.

> Today all this is gone, even in naturalist fiction. Before the Romantic revolution, characters try to advance themselves. After it, they try to save themselves. (39)
