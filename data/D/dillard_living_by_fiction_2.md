# On Fiction, Elitism, and Mass Audiences

This idea, she says, is "essentially elitist, curmudgeonly, and morally wrong." The fact "that fiction, as a field, is not entirely the prerogative of specialists" is one of its greatest strengths.

> And the fact that fiction is not the prerogative of specialists militates in favor of its traditional virtues simply because nonspecialists prefer depth to abstract surface. Specialists are invested in form; nonspecialists like lots of realized content. (77)

Philistinism--what Dillard calls the extreme version of the "assumption that fiction, even when it is literature, should answer to its audience by pleasing it" is, while unnerving, 

> by and large a healthy state. That fiction is not yet the exclusive province of specialists, that those who make it their business to understand it are not quite yet priests, that most of it requires of its audience no initiate status--these things distinguish fiction from most of the best contemporary poetry, music, painting, and sculpture. ... All sorts of people read good fiction. ... By contrast, the other contemporary arts are marvelously down to essences. They have rid themselves of all impure elements, including an audience. (78)

However, she is able to bounce from this position--without self-contradiction and also without any synthesis, really, to say that

> I would be the last to argue that fiction's wide audience keeps it responsible. Anyone could far more easily argue that it keeps it mediocre and stunted. This latter position is as familiar and self-evident as it is valid. God only knows what works of art will not see print in this generation, or ever, in the name of that wide audience whose wide neck one so often wishes to wring. Fiction's wide audience does not keep it responsible; it merely inhibits its development away from the traditional. (79)
