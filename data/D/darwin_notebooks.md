# Darwin's Thoughts on Marriage

Not sure where I first found this. This is Darwin's side-by-side comparison on whether or not to get married.

> **Not Marry?**
> - Freedom to go where one liked
> - choice of Society and little of it. 
> - Conversation of clever men at clubs
> - Not forced to visit relatives, and 
> - to bend in every trifle
> - to have the expense and anxiety of children - 
> - perhaps quarrelling - 
> - Loss of time - 
> - cannot read in the Evenings - 
> - fatness and idleness - 
> - anxiety and responsibility - 
> - less money for books 
> - if many children forced to gain one's bread (But then it is very 
> - bad for one's health to work too much). 
> - Perhaps my wife won't like 
> - London, then the sentence is banishment and degradation with indolent, idle fool.
>
> **Marry?**
> - Children - (if it please God) - 
> - constant companion, who will feel interested in one 
> - (a friend in old age) - 
> - object to be beloved and played with - better than a dog anyhow 
> - Home, and someone to take care of house
> - Charms of Music and female Chit Chat - 
> - These things good for ones health but terrible loss of time
> - My God, it is unthinkable to think of spending
> - one's whole life, like a neuter bee, working, working, and nothing after all 
> - No, no won't do 
> - Imagine living all one's days solitarily in smoky
> - dirty London House - 
> - Only picture to yourself a nice soft wife on a sofa
> - with good fire, and books and music perhaps - compare this vision with
> - dingy reality.
> - Marry! Marry! Marry!
