# On British Weather

Fussell thinks the conventionally horrible nature of English weather was a literary fabrication:

> it is only after the [First World] war that the British weather becomes a cause of outrage and a sufficient reason for departure. Before the war one had been rather proud of the fogs and damps and pleased to exhibit staunchness and good humor in adapting to them. ... Actually, England is a very habitable country. The fact is that the post-war hatred of the weather was a convention of the lettered to advertise England's deficiencies in other ways, especially those resulting from D.O.R.A. and betokening chapel-morality and related Calvinisms. Indeed, British weather is more temperate than that of the northeastern United States. ... Yet the weather of the United States has not become a joke or a byword, which means that it is not deployable as an emblem of grey Puritan repression and the conventiale spirit the way British weather is.
