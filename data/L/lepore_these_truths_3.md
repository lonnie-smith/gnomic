# On Preaching and Abolitionism

David Walker, black revivalist preacher, activist, pamphleteer—his contribution to radicalizing the abolitionist movement and hardening sectional differences on abolition.

> Combining the exhortations of a revivalist preacher with the rabble-rousing of a Jacksonian political candidate, Walker preached that, without the saving redemption of abolition, there would come a political apocalypse, the wages of the sin of slavery. ... He insisted on the right to revolution. Addressing his white readers, he wrote, "Now, Americans! I ask you candidly, was your sufferings under Great Britain, one hundredth part as cruel and tyrannical as you have rendered ours under you?"

> The preaching of David Walker, even more than the preaching of Lyman Beecher or Charles Grandison Finney, set the nation on fire. It was prosecutorial; it was incendiary. It was also widely read. ... In 1830, a group of slaves plotting a rebellion were found with a copy of [Walker's] _Appeal_. With Walker, the antislavery argument for gradual emancipation, with compensation for slave owners, became untenable. Abolitionists began arguing for immediate emancipation. And southern antislavery societies shut their doors. As late as 1827, the number of antislavery groups in the South had outnumbered those in the North by more than four to one. ... Walker's _Appeal_ ended the antislavery movement in the South and radicalized it in the North. Garrison published the first issue of the _Liberator_ on January 1, 1831. It begins with words as uncompromising as Walker's: "I am in earnest—I will not equivocate—I will not excuse—I will not retreat a single inch—AND I WILL BE HEARD."

Then, following Nat Turner's rebellion,

> The Virginia legislature debated the possibility of emancipating its slaves, fearing "a Nat Turner might be in every family." ... Instead, the legislature passed new laws banning the teaching of slaves to read and write, and prohibiting, too, teaching slaves about the Bible. (203-5)
