# On Revolution

A major theme of _These Truths_ is that the American Revolution is more or less a continuous and ongoing process, as enlightenment liberal ideals, in particular the equality of humankind--struggle against various forms of political oppression. The language of the Declaration of Independence has played a prominent role in the revolution:

> [John] Brown had planned to lead an armed revolution throughout the South. At the nearby farm and school where he and his men had assembled, soldiers found sixteen boxes of weapons and ammunition, along with boxes of papers, including thousands of copies of his 1858 constitution ... They also found, rolled up into a scroll, a "Declaration of Liberty by the Representatives of the Slave Population of the United States of America."
>
> "We hold these truths to be Self Evident; That All Men are Created Equal," it began, proceeding to establish a right to revolution: "The history of Slavery in the United tates, is a history of injustice & Cruelties inflicted upon the Slave in evry conceivable way, & in barbarity not surpassed by the most Savage Tribes. It is the embodiment of all that is Evil, and ruinous to a Nation; and subversive of all Good." (283)
