# On Revolution

A major theme of _These Truths_ is that the American Revolution is more or less a continuous and ongoing process, as enlightenment liberal ideals, in particular the equality of humankind--struggle against various forms of political oppression. 

This dynamic played out in the Caribbean both during and after the colonial era. For example,

> Libertarian opposition to the Stamp Act was thriving in the continental colonies, but almost non-existent in the Caribbean colonies, where slaves vastly outnumbered slave owners and depended on the British army to suppress uprisings. “When troops fired into a crowd in March 1770, killing five men, the Sons of Liberty called it a ‘massacre’ and cried for relief from the tyranny of a standing army. But on the islands, planters called not for less military presence but more, the colonial assembly on St. Kitts begging the king to send troops to protect the colonists from ‘the turbulent and savage dispositions of the Negroes ever prone to Riots and Rebellions.’” (87-88)

Slaveholders were afraid that radical democratic ideas might fuel slave revolts, as it did, most notably in Haiti. Haiti’s slave rebellion in 1791

> was a war for independence, the second in the Western world. American owners of slaves were terrified by the events unfolding in Haiti—their darkest fears realized. But to some radicals in New England, the Haitian revolution was the inevitable next step in the progress of the freedom of man (143)

For the American Revolution itself, democratic principles were eclipsed by slavery in ways that were not lost on anyone:

> Spectators on both sides of the Atlantic were aware of the ironies; Samuel Johnson, hired to pen a response to the Colonial Congress’s no-taxation-without-representation-flavored complaints, in Taxation No Tyranny: “How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes”? — sentiments shared by the growing American abolition movement (91-92)

Lepore's argument is at times diffuse, due in part to the fact that the rhetorical thrust of the book is spread out across 800 pages instead of gathered into a tidy essay.

> Inevitably, slavery cast its long and terrible shadow over these statements of principle [egalitarian pre-revolutionary resolutions passed by colonial assemblies]: slavery, in fact, had made those statements of principle possible. (96)

What it might mean for slavery to have made revolutionary principles possible, even while it manifestly acted as a violation of them, isn't always very clear, but has to do with the way that the specific form of revolutionary rhetoric, most memorably instantiated in the _Declaration of Independence_, forced upon everyone a realization of the inherent instability of a democratic system which happened to exclude women, slaves, and Native Americans.

> Slavery does not exist outside politics. Slavery is a form of politics, and slave rebellion a form of violent political dissent. The Zenger trial [Zenger was a printer tried for libel in 1733 for publishing material critical of the governor of New York] and the New York slave conspiracy were much more than a dispute over freedom of the press and a foiled slave rebellion; they were part of a debate about the nature of political opposition, and together they established its limits. Both Cosby’s opponents and Caesar’s followers allegedly plotted to depose the governor. One kind of rebellion was celebrated, the other suppressed—a division that would endure. In American history, the relationship between liberty and slavery is at once deep and dark: the threat of black rebellion gave a license to white political opposition. The American political tradition was forged by philosophers and statesmen, by princes and by writers, and it was forged, too, by slaves. (64).

The language of the _Declaration_ continually reemerges in moments of dissent:

> [John] Brown had planned to lead an armed revolution throughout the South. At the nearby farm and school where he and his men had assembled, soldiers found sixteen boxes of weapons and ammunition, along with boxes of papers, including thousands of copies of his 1858 constitution ... They also found, rolled up into a scroll, a "Declaration of Liberty by the Representatives of the Slave Population of the United States of America."
>
> "We hold these truths to be Self Evident; That All Men are Created Equal," it began, proceeding to establish a right to revolution: "The history of Slavery in the United States, is a history of injustice & Cruelties inflicted upon the Slave in every conceivable way, & in barbarity not surpassed by the most Savage Tribes. It is the embodiment of all that is Evil, and ruinous to a Nation; and subversive of all Good." (283)
