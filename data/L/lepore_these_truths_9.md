# On the History of Gun Control

State-level regulation of guns--prohibitions on concealed carry, for example--had been fairly common in the Ninteenth Century. Initial federal gun control legislation was uncontroversial, and had even been supported by the NRA:

> The National Rifle Association had been founded in 1871 by a former reporter from the _New York Times_, as a sporting and hunting association; most of its business consisted of sponsoring target-shooting competitions. Not only did the NRA not oppose firearms regulation, it supported and even sponsored it. In the 1920s and 1930s ... the NRA endorsed gun control legislation, lobbying for new state laws ... Public-safety-minded firearms regulation was uncontroversial. The NRA supported both the uniform 1934 National Firearms Act--the first federal gun control legislation--and the 1938 Federal Firearms Act, which together prohibitively taxed the private ownership of automatic weapons ("machine guns"), mandated licensing for handgun dealers, introduced waiting periods for handgun buyers, required permits for anyone wishing to carry a concealed weapon, and created a licensing system for dealers. In 1939, in a unanimous decision in _U.S. v. Miller_, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld these measures after FDR's solicitor general, Robert H. Jackson, argued that the Second Amendment is "restricted to the keeping and bearing of arms by the people collectively for their common defense and security." The text of the amendment, Jackson argued, makes clear that the right "is not one which may be utilized for private purposes but only one which exists where the arms are borne in the militia or some other military organization provided for by law and intended for the protection of the state."
