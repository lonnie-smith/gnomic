# On the rise of nonpartisan journalism in the nineteenth century

> Parties come and go, but a party system—a stable pair of parties—has characterized American politics since the ratification debates. In American history the change from one party system to another has nearly always been associated with a revolution in communications that allows the people to shake loose of the control of parties. In the 1790s, during the rise of the first party system, picket Federalists against Republicans, the number of newspapers had swelled. During the shift to the second party system, which, beginning in 1833, pitted Democrat against the newly founded Whig party, not only did the number of newspapers rise, but their prices plummeted. The newspapers of the first party system, which were also known as "commercial advertisers,"hey consisted chiefly of partisan commentary and ads, and generally sold for six cents an issue. The new papers cost only one cent, and were far more widely read. The rise of the so-called penny press also marks the beginning of the trial of "facts" over "opinion" In American journalist, mainly because the penny press aimed at a different, broader, and less exclusively partisan, audience. The _New York Sun_ appeared in 1833. "It shines for all" what is common-man motto. "The object of this paper is to lay before the public, at a price with in the means of everyone, ALL THE NEWS OF THE DAY," it boasted. It dispensed with subscriptions and instead was circulated at newsstands, where it was sold for cash, to anyone who had a ready penny. Its front page was filled not with advertising but with news. The penny press was a "free press," as James Gordon Bennett of the _New York Herald_ put it, because it wasn't beholden to  parties. (Bennett, born in Scotland, and emigrated to the United States after reading Benjamin Franklin's _Autobiography_.) Since the paper was sold at newsstands, rather than mail to subscribers, he explained, its editors and writers were"entirely ignorant who are its readers who are not." They couldn't favor their readers politics' because they didn't know them. "We should support no party," Bennett insisted. "We shall endeavor to record facts."

They do not easily differ to the mere name of any fellow man, they are never inclined to rest upon any man's authority; but, on the contrary, they are unremitting in their efforts to find out the weaker points of their neighbors doctrine.
