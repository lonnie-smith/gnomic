# On Freedom of Speech and the Abolition Movement

> In December [1860], when Frederick Douglass was slated to speak in Boston's Tremont Temple on the occasion of the anniversary of John Brown's execution, a mob broke into the hall to silence him. To answer them, Douglass later delivered a blistering "Plea for Free Speech," in which ... he placed abolition in the tradition of the nation's founding. "No right was deemed by the fathers of the Government more sacred than the right of free speech," Douglass said, and "Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one's thoughts and opinions has ceased to exist." (288-9)

> The seventeenth-century battle for freedom of expression had been fought by writers like John Milton, opposing the suppression of religious dissent; the eighteenth-century struggle for the freedom of the press had been fought by printers like Benjamin Franklin and John Peter Zegner, opposing the suppression of criticism of the government; and the nineteenth century's fight for free speech had been waged by abolitionists opposing southern slave owners, who had been unwilling to subject slavery to debate.

# On the Confederacy as an Antidemocratic State

Lepore paints an interesting picture of the moments in which the Confederacy was born, emphasizing suppression of dissent, and free speech generally, as part of its fundamental makeup:

> Opposition to free speech had long been the position of slave owners, a position taken at the constitutional convention and extended through the gag rule, antiliteracy laws, bans on the mails, and the suppression of speakers. An aversion to political debate also structured the Confederacy, which had both a distinctive character and a lasting influence on Americans' ideas about federal authority as against popular sovereignty. Secessionists were attempting to build a modern, proslavery, antidemocratic state. In order to wage a war, the leaders of this fundamentally antidemocratic state needed popular support. Such support was difficult to gain and impossible to maintain. The Confederacy therefore suppressed dissent.
>
> ... The most ardent supporters of secession were the wealthiest plantation owners; the least ardent were the great majority of white male voters: poor men who did not own slaves. The most effective way to persuade these men to support secession was to argue that even though they didn't own slaves, their lives were made better by the existence of the institution, since it meant that they were spared the most demeaning work. Prosecessionists made this argument repeatedly, and with growing intensity. ...
>
> Nevertheless, rather than trusting a decision about secession to the voters, or even to a ratifying convention, Georgia legislator Thomas R. R. Cobb advised his legislature to make the decision itself: "Wait not till the grog shops and cross roads shall send up a discordant voice from a divided people." When Georgia did hold a convention, its delegates were deeply split. The secessionists cooked the numbers in order to insure their victory and proceeded to require all delegates to sign a pledge supporting secession even if they had voted against it. One of the first things the new state of Georgia did was to pass a law that made dissent punishable by death.

> As hard as secessionists fought for popular support, and as aggressively as they suppressed dissent, they were nevertheless only partially successful. Four states in the upper South only seceded after Confederate forces fired on U.S. troops at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 12. Even then, Virginia kept on stalling until, on April 17, Governor Henry Wise walked into the Virginia convention and took out his pistol and said that, by his order, Virginia was now at war with the federal government, and that if anyone wanted to shoot him for treason, they'd have to wrestle his pistol away from him first.
