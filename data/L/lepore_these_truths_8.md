# On the Racist Roots of the Populist Movement

Lepore's chapters on populism and progressivism in the era following the Civil War are some of the most interesting in the book. For example, we see how racism and nativism have long gone hand-in-hand with left-wing economic and democratic reforms.

> Populism entered American politics at the end of the nineteenth century, and it never left. It pitted "the people," meaning everyone but the rich, against corporations, which fought back in the courts by defining themselves as "persons"; and it pitted "the people," meaning white people, against nonwhite people who were fighting for citizenship and whose ability to fight back in the courts was far more limited, since those fights required well-paid lawyers. (348)

> As the suffering of farmers and wage workers grew, so did the ranks of the People's Party, which became the most successful third party in American history. Between 1889 and 1893, the mortgages on so many farms were foreclosed that 90 percent of farmland fell into the hands of bankers. The richest 1 percent of Americans owned 51 percent of the nation's wealth, and the poorest 44 percent owned less than 2 percent. Populists didn't oppose capitalism; they opposed monopolism, ...
>
> For all its passionate embrace of political equality and human rights and its energetic championing of suffrage, the People's Party rested on a deep and abiding commitment to exclude from full citizenship anyone from or descended from anyone from Africa or Asia. ... Populism racism and nativism rank among its longest-lasting legacies. (343)

# Populism vs Progressivism

According to Lepore, progressivism has always been an intellectually-elite, statist counter-movement to populism.

> Populism also pitted the people against the state. During populism's first rise, the state as a political entity became an object of formal academic study through political science, one of a new breed of academic fields known as the social sciences. ... For [Woodrow] Wilson's generation of political scientists, the study of the state replaced the study of the people. The erection of the state became, in their view, a bulwark against populism. In the first decades of the twentieth century, populism would yield to progressivism as urban reformers applied the new social sciences to the study of political problems, to be remedied by the intervention of the state. (348)

You can see the roots of modern-day Tea Party anti-government sentiment in nineteenth-century populism. If you think that policies (or "causes") play a lesser role in the evolution of parties and political sentiment than do issues of cultural identity, it becomes easy to see how the modern Republican party forms a coalition around anti-government/anti-intellectual/white supremacist sentiment over and against a neoliberal technocratic coalition in the Democratic party.

> Progressivism had roots in late nineteenth-century populism; Progressivism was the middle-class version: indoors, quiet, passionless. Populists raised hell; Progressives read pamphlets. ... Progressives championed the same causes as Populists, and took their side in railing against big business, but while Populists generally wanted less government, Progressives wanted more, seeking solutions in reform legislation and in the establishment of bureaucracies, especially government agencies.
>
> Populists believed that the system was broken; Progressives believed that the government could fix it. Conservatives, who happened to dominate the Supreme Court, didn't believe that there was anything to fix but believed that, if there was, the market would fix it. Notwithstanding conservatives' influence on the judiciary, Progressivism spanned both parties. (364)

# On the Secret Ballot and Voter Suppression

The secret ballot is a particularly interesting populist policy innovation, in that it simultaneously functioned as an effective anti-corruption measure and as a convenient method of voter suppression:

> Many of the reforms proposed by the populists had the effect of diminishing the political power of blacks and immigrants. Chief among them was the Australian ballot, more usually known as the secret ballot, which, by serving as a de facto literacy tests, disenfrancised both black men in the rural South and new immigrants in northern cities. In 1888 the Kentucky state legislature became the first in the nation to attempt the reform, in the city of Louisville. "The election last Tuesday was the first municipal election I have ever known which was not bought outright," one observer wrote to the _Nation_ after Election Day. ...
>
> ... Quickest to adopt the reform were the states of the former Confederacy, where the reform appealed to legislatures eager to find legal ways to keep black men from voting. In 1890, Mississippi held a constitutional convention and adopted a new state constitution that included an "Understanding Clause": voters were required to pass oral examination on the Constitution, on the grounds that "very few Negroes understood the clauses of the Constitution." ... In the South, the secret ballot was adopted in this same spirit. Both by law and by brute force, southern legislators, state by state, and poll workers, precinct by precinct, denied black men the right to vote. In Louisiana, black voter registration dropped from 130,000 in 1898 to 5,300 in 1908, and to 730 in 1910. (344)
