# On the Racist Roots of the Populist Movement

Lepore's chapters on populism and progressivism in the era following the Civil War are some of the most interesting in the book. For example, we see how racism and nativism have long gone hand-in-hand with left-wing economic and democratic reforms.

> Populism entered American politics at the end of the nineteenth century, and it never left. It pitted "the people," meaning everyone but the rich, against corporations, which fought back in the courts by defining themselves as "persons"; and it pitted "the people," meaning white people, against nonwhite people who were fighting for citizenship and whose ability to fight back in the courts was far more limited, since those fights required well-paid lawyers. (348)

> As the suffering of farmers and wage workers grew, so did the ranks of the People's Party, which became the most successful third party in American history. Between 1889 and 1893, the mortgages on so many farms were foreclosed that 90 percent of farmland fell into the hands of bankers. The richest 1 percent of Americans owned 51 percent of the nation's wealth, and the poorest 44 percent owned less than 2 percent. Populists didn't oppose capitalism; they opposed monopolism, ...
>
> For all its passionate embrace of political equality and human rights and its energetic championing of suffrage, the People's Party rested on a deep and abiding commitment to exclude from full citizenship anyone from or descended from anyone from Africa or Asia. ... Populism racism and nativism rank among its longest-lasting legacies. (343)

# Populism vs Progressivism

According to Lepore, progressivism has always been an intellectually-elite, statist counter-movement to populism.

> Populism also pitted the people against the state. During populism's first rise, the state as a political entity became an object of formal academic study through political science, one of a new breed of academic fields known as the social sciences. ... For [Woodrow] Wilson's generation of political scientists, the study of the state replaced the study of the people. The erection of the state became, in their view, a bulwark against populism. In the first decades of the twentieth century, populism would yield to progressivism as urban reformers applied the new social sciences to the study of political problems, to be remedied by the intervention of the state. (348)

You can see the roots of modern-day Tea Party anti-government sentiment in nineteenth-century populism. If you think that policies (or "causes") play a lesser role in the evolution of parties and political sentiment than do issues of cultural identity, it becomes easy to see how the modern Republican party forms a coalition around anti-government/anti-intellectual/white supremacist sentiment over and against a neoliberal technocratic coalition in the Democratic party.

> Progressivism had roots in late nineteenth-century populism; Progressivism was the middle-class version: indoors, quiet, passionless. Populists raised hell; Progressives read pamphlets. ... Progressives championed the same causes as Populists, and took their side in railing against big business, but while Populists generally wanted less government, Progressives wanted more, seeking solutions in reform legislation and in the establishment of bureaucracies, especially government agencies.
>
> Populists believed that the system was broken; Progressives believed that the government could fix it. Conservatives, who happened to dominate the Supreme Court, didn't believe that there was anything to fix but believed that, if there was, the market would fix it. Notwithstanding conservatives' influence on the judiciary, Progressivism spanned both parties. (364)

# On the Secret Ballot and Voter Suppression

The secret ballot is a particularly interesting populist policy innovation, in that it simultaneously functioned as an effective anti-corruption measure and as a convenient method of voter suppression:

> Many of the reforms proposed by the populists had the effect of diminishing the political power of blacks and immigrants. Chief among them was the Australian ballot, more usually known as the secret ballot, which, by serving as a de facto literacy tests, disenfrancised both black men in the rural South and new immigrants in northern cities. In 1888 the Kentucky state legislature became the first in the nation to attempt the reform, in the city of Louisville. "The election last Tuesday was the first municipal election I have ever known which was not bought outright," one observer wrote to the _Nation_ after Election Day. ...
>
> ... Quickest to adopt the reform were the states of the former Confederacy, where the reform appealed to legislatures eager to find legal ways to keep black men from voting. In 1890, Mississippi held a constitutional convention and adopted a new state constitution that included an "Understanding Clause": voters were required to pass oral examination on the Constitution, on the grounds that "very few Negroes understood the clauses of the Constitution." ... In the South, the secret ballot was adopted in this same spirit. Both by law and by brute force, southern legislators, state by state, and poll workers, precinct by precinct, denied black men the right to vote. In Louisiana, black voter registration dropped from 130,000 in 1898 to 5,300 in 1908, and to 730 in 1910. (344)

# On the New Deal's Reorganization of Political Ideology

Lepore points to 1930s as the moment when American political ideologies began to coalesce into their current forms.

> Franklin Roosevelt's presidency marked the beginning of a "new deal order," an American-led rights-based liberalism that Lyndon Johnson would carry into the 1960s. In the nineteenth century, "liberalism" meant advocacy of laissez-faire capitalism. The meaning of the term changed during the Progressive Era, when self-styled Progressives, borrowing from Populism, began attempting to reform laissez-faire capitalism by using the tools of collective action and appeals to the people adopted by Populists; in the 1930s, these efforts came together as New Deal liberalism.
>
> All that while, a new kind of conservatism was growing, too. It consisted not only of businessmen who opposed government regulation of the economy but also of Americans, chiefly rural Americans, who objected to government interference in their lives. These two strands of conservatism were largely separate in the 1930s, but they'd already begun moving closer together, especially in their animpsity toward the paternalism of liberalism. (444)

# Hayek and the Emergence of the Modern Conservative Movement

Opposition to authoritarianism--in its fascist forms in the early century, and later in its communist forms--fueled the emergence of the new conservativism.

> Disavowing the economic nationalism that had followed the end of the First World War, the Bretton Woods Conference committed itself to open markets and free trade, and to Keynesianism, founding the International Monetary Fund, which would establish a fixed rate of currency exchange. Keynes chaired the commission that established the international bank, which eventually became known as the World Bank.
>
> Even as this order was being built, a conservative assault on it began. ... Austrian-born Political scientist Friedrich A. Hayek published an American edition of _The Road to Serfdom_, a work that established the fundamental framework of modern economic conservativism. ...
>
> Hayek ... had been a critic of Keynesian economics since the 1930s. "I wish I could make my 'progressive' friends ... understand that democracy is possible only under capitalism and that collectivist experiments lead inevitably to fascism of one sort or another," he'd written .. When governments assume control over economic affairs, Hayek warned, the people become slaves: "What is called economic power, while it can be an instrument of coercion, is, in the hands of private individuals, never exclusive or complete power, never power over the whole life of a person. But centralized as an instrument of political power it creates a degree of dependence scarcely distinguishable from slavery."

The Cold War fueled conservativism :

> McCarthyism ... was part of a rising tide of American conservativism. Its leading thinkers were refugees from fascist or communist regimes. They opposed collectivism and centralized planning and celebrated personal liberty, individual rights, and the free market. (553)

Cold Warriors like the political consultants Whitaker and Baxter, instrumental in tanking Truman's health care plan,

> sounded the same notes as Hayek's "road to serfdom" ... "Hitler and Stalin and the socialist government of Great Britain all have used the opiate of socialized medicine to deaden the pain of lost liberty and lull the people into non-resistance. Old World contaigion of compulsory health insurance ... will mark the beginning of the end of free institutions in America." (553-4)

This is characteristic of Lepore's running thesis about revolution, where the consequences of a focus on liberty are complex, at once fueling social justice movements (as when the Civil Rights movement was boosted by Soviet propaganda criticizing America's hypocrisy when it came to racial equality) and the kind of conservative individualism that has worked to oppose social justice.

# On the Ideological Sorting of American Political Parties

Lepore places the blame for ideological sorting and party polarization at the feet of pollsters and political consultants, though at least initially political scientists were arguing that the muddled ideology of the two parties led voters to make uninformed decisions:

> Political scientists applied survey methods to the study of American politics and relied on the results to make policy recommendations. In 1950, when the distance between the parties was smaller than it has been either before or since—and voters had a hard time figuring out which party was conservative and which liberal--the American Political Science Association’s Committee on Political Parties issued a report called “Toward a More Responsible Two-Party System.” The problem with American democracy, the committee argued, is that parties are too alike, and too weak. The report recommended strengthening every element of the party system … as well as establishing a starker difference between party platforms. “If the two parties do not develop alternative programs that can be executed,” the committee warned, “the voter’s frustration and the mounting ambiguities of national policy might set in motion more extreme tendencies to the political left and the political right.” …

> Exactly this kind of sorting did eventually come to pass, not to the favor of one party or the other but, instead, to the detriment of everyone. It may have been the brainchild of quantitative political scientists, but it was implemented by pollsters and political consultants, using computers to segment the electorate. (545-6)

I'm not convinced that sorting the parties along left/right ideological divisions is as bad a thing as Lepore thinks here. For example, it's hard to say whether the Democratic party move left on civil rights in the 1960s was more a cause or a result of ideological sorting--but it's far from obvious that it's a bad thing that party affiliation now serves as a much clearer signal to voters where a candidate stands on civil rights issues now than it did in the 1950s.
