# On America as "A Christian Nation"

Lepore argues that the notion of America as a "Christian nation" is an artifact of the Second Great Awakening

> That the revival of Christianity coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration [of Independence], an anniversary made all the more mystical when the news spread that both Jefferson and Adams had died that very day, July 4, 1826, as if by the hand of God, meant that the Declaration itself took on a religious cast. The self-evident, secular truths of the Declaration of Independence became, to evangelical Americans, the truths of revealed religion.

> To say that this marked a turn away from the spirit of the nation's founding is to wildly understate the case. The United States was founded  during the most secular era in American history, either before or since. In the late eighteenth century, church membership was low, and anticlerical feeling was high. It is no accident that the Constitution does not mention God. Philadelphia physician Benjamin Rush wondered, politely, whether this error might be corrected, assuming it to have been an oversight. "Perhaps an acknowledgement might be made of his goodness or of his providence in the proposed amendments," he urged. No correction was made.

> The United States was not founded as a Christian nation. The Constitution prohibits religious tests for officeholders. The Bill of Rights forbids the federal government from establishing a religion, James Madison having argued that to establish a religion would be "to foster in those who still reject it, a suspicion that its friends are too conscious of its fallacies to trust it to its own merits." These were neither casual omissions nor accidents; they represented an intentional disavowal of a constitutional relationship between church and state, a disavowal that was not infrequently specifically stated. In 1797, John Adams signed the Treaty of Tripoli, securing the release of American captives in North Africa, and promising that the United States would not engage in a holy war with Islam because "the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion."

> But during the Second Great Awakening, evangelicals recast the nation's origins as avowedly Christian. "Upon what was America founded?" Maria Steward asked, and answered, "Upon religion and pure principles." Lyman Beecher argued that the Republic, "in its constitution and laws, is of heavenly origin." (199-200)
