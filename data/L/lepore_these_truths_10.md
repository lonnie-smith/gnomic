# On the Role of Computers in Shaping Modern Democracy

> The machines built to plot the trajectories and force of missiles and bombs would come to transform economic systems, social structures, and the workings of politics. Computers are often left out of the study of history and government, but, stating at the end of the Second World War, history and government cannot be understood without them. Democracies relied of an informed electorate; computers, the product of long and deep study and experiment, would both explode and unsettle the very nature of knowledge.

Lepore's treatment of computing is one of many ways in which her history is motivated by recent events. It's hard to imagine anyone writing about the power of computers to "explode and unsettle the very nature of knowledge" even five years ago.

Lepore's discussion of UNIVAC, built in 1946 for the Census Bureau, is similarly proleptic:

> Commercially applied, UNIVAC and its heirs would transform American business, straightaway cutting costs and accelerating production by streamlining managerial and administrative tasks, such as payroll and inventory, and eventually turning people into consumers whose habits could be tracked and whose spending could be calculated, and even predicted. Politically, it would wreak havoc, splitting the electorate into so many atoms.

> The technology that made it possible to sort citizens [for the census] would make it possible to sort consumers, too. â€¦ In much the same way that advertisers segmented markets, political consultants would sort voters into different piles, too, and send them different messages.
