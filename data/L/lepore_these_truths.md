# On the Democratic Potential of Photography

Frederick Douglass theorizes about the democratic potential of photography:

> Frederick Douglass, an early convert [to the new art form of photography], became a theorist of photography. "Negroes can never have impartial portraits at the hands of white artists," he said. "It seems to us next to impossible for white men to take likenesses of black men, without most grossly exaggerating their distinctive features." But a photograph was no caricature. Douglass therefore sat, again and again, in a portraitist's studio: he became the most photographed man in nineteenth-century America, his likeness taken more often than Twain or even Lincoln. Douglass believed both that photography would help realize the promise of democracy by capturing rich and poor alike. "What was once the special and exclusive luxury of the rich and great is now the privilege of all," he said. "The humblest servant girl may now possess a picture of herself such as the wealth of kings could not purchase fifty years ago." Technological progress, he predicted, would usher in an age of equality, justice, and peace:
> > The growing inter-communication of distant nations, the rapid transmission of intelligence over the globe—the worldwide ramifications of commerce—bringing together the knowledge, the skill, and the mental power of the world, cannot but dispel prejudice, dissolve the granite barriers of arbitrary power, bring the world into peace and unity, and at last crown the world with justice, liberty, and brotherly kindness.
